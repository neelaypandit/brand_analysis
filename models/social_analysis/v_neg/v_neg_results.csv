Southwest Airlines prides itself on their culture and rightly so. They treat their employees are well so that the employees treat the customers well, which is a basic strategy that many companies have adopted. Clearly this strategy works for customer facing employees and employee retention. This is not a good strategy for technical employees. In the tech industry the best employees leave after a few years, primarily for career growth. An inquisitive technologist can not stay with a company like SWA because leadership is afraid of innovation particularly in their back end systems that cause these meltdowns.\n\nIn this most recent event it was a Firewall that failed. Well I have to tell you that is a horrible reason because if a Firewall can melt down a production that means it was not clustered with redundant Firewalls that could self heal by spinning up a new firewall and replace the failing firewall automatically, which is basic cloud functionality. Then that leads me to think that this happened in a data center and this could be a physical appliance, which is even worse. A company that proclaims to NOT be a tech company should NOT be running their own data center, simply because this in not the 1990's. Bottom line, expect these failures to continue until SWA decide to change the technical culture, which means bring in new leadership who understands tech culture. Leaders that can guide a Digital Transformation will bring innovation and improve these systems. "", ""Hi I just wanted to share something with you all that could possibly help someone or encourage you to speak up in a possible situation like this. \n\n Small backstory, I'm 22F and scared of flying pretty much my whole life but I have a 12 yo sister that is also terrified of flying that I have to be strong for. I mean we both can't be scared and lost right? Anyways.. last night I flew after avoiding it for almost 3 years. I flew with the sister I mentioned and my mom who happens to be a manager for Southwest Airlines, which we were flying. \n\nI had two flights and they were rather short and the layover for the second flight was only 30 minutes or so. I flew from Panama City to Dallas & Dallas to Houston. Although filled with so much anxiety and doubt.. I did it and the first flight went very well with very little turbulence only when we took off. Landing was perfect with the wings seemingly stable all the way down. No turbulence. Turbulence pretty much makes my fear of flying, the little the better. \n\nNow my second flight. Things were going so well with only around 35 of us on the entire plane so we all had to sit a certain way for balance and weight requirements. We were moments away from taking off on the runway and we couldn't help but notice a guy that was positioning himself very oddly in the seat directly across from us. He had completely took off his seat belt, put his legs across the seat and had his back and head pressured up against THE EMERGENCY EXIT DOOR. \n\nWe had to be seconds from taking off. Yes he had an entire row to hisself and yes he was in the exit column. He's suppose to be the guy to assist us if emergency… yea right. The guy didn't have a care in the world and was scrolling on his phone meanwhile panic almost immediately set for my family and I. We were the only ones who could see him siting like this. And as we were getting closer to taking off we were going back and fourth, debating on whether we should just speak up or not. All the flight attendants were in their seats and it's just so awkward to have to tell a grown man to sit properly on a plane for his safety and all of ours. But my mom working for Southwest Airlines she knew no matter how uncomfortable and awkward confronting this man may be, safety is always first. Always and she is to practice that whenever, wherever. She asked the man nicely if he could sit properly in his seat for take off and he questioned her as to why... She was nice to him again and informed him that it just isn't safe for obvious reasons. He then fixed his position with attitude but nonetheless, fixed his position. Right after he did, the plane started to accelerate and lift. He sat properly almost just in time and ironically he stayed just like that the entire flight. \n\nThe weight of anxiety lifted off our back seriously I mean no, the emergency door probably doesn't open that easily but who knows and who cares. That man could've gotten hurt or worse just speak up folks!!! I'm so glad my mom did when I probably wouldn't have had the courage to. I'm so glad I got to fly again and get one step closer to just accepting that way of traveling. Safe travels to you all on your journeys.

Just one day after the jury had been selected and hours after [a special master had been appointed by the judge to investigate Fox\'s lawyers](https://www.nbcnews.com/media/judge-appoints-special-master-investigate-fox-news-dominion-defamation-rcna80289)—and as we were getting our popcorn ready—Fox and Dominion reached an out-of-court settlement.                          \n                 \n- [Fox News agreed to pay Dominion $787.5 million](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/18/fox-news-and-dominion-settle-election-defamation-lawsuit-judge-says.html), presumably to avoid the years of litigation necessary to fight a case they were likely to lose, as well as any subsequent appeals (the prospect of further humiliation probably didn\'t make the trial look very appetizing, either). Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis announced that the case had been ""resolved"" after bringing the jury and 12 alternates back into the courtroom after a protracted break in proceedings.                          \n                 \n- The massive cash settlement is good for Dominion (and let\'s be honest, any loss for Fox is a win for humanity) but it\'s far less than the full $1.6 billion originally sought by the voting systems company. [Dominion attorney Stephen Shackleford said: ""Money is accountability and we got that today from Fox.""](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/18/fox-news-and-dominion-settle-election-defamation-lawsuit-judge-says.html) That much is true: It may be less than they asked for, but they\'re getting it now, and Fox can\'t appeal an out-of-court settlement. Still, it appears that part of the settlement agreement is that Fox News will not have to acknowledge the lies they knowingly spread to their millions of viewers about Dominion in the aftermath of the 2020 election. So we won\'t get the satisfaction—or the benefit to society writ large—of hearing Fox News hosts report that Fox News hosts lied.                          \n                 \n**Despite Fox\'s best efforts to spin the settlement as a victory, most of us can see it for what it is: an admission of guilt in the face of a mountain of evidence against them.**                          \n                 \n- Some pundits have said that not even a public admission of guilt or the the loss of a jury trial could convince the Fox News faithful that Trump really did lose in 2020, but we\'re not so sure. Fox News Host and commentator Howard Kurtz [admitted that ""It\'s been a very rough week"" for the network and reported the settlement on-air](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2023/04/18/fox-news-dominion-defamation-trial-coverage-js-ff-orig.cnn-business), after having been [previously barred from covering the trial](https://thehill.com/homenews/media/3953575-fox-news-host-who-previously-said-he-was-barred-from-reporting-on-dominion-suit-says-he-will-cover-trial-fair-and-down-the-middle/) by the network. He read Fox\'s statement: ""Dominion\'s lawsuit is a political crusade in search of a financial windfall, but the real cost would be cherished first amendment rights. While Dominion has pushed irrelevant and misleading information to generate headlines, FOX News remains steadfast in protecting the rights of a free press…"" Lol. Yep, that\'s the kind of spin we\'ve come to know and hate from the network, all right.                          \n                 \n- Evidence unearthed during the discovery phase of this not-quite-a-trial has still had huge implications for Fox. [Last month, a survey commissioned by *Variety* found that, as a direct result of the internal Fox communications coming to light, 21 percent of viewers lost trust in the network, and 13 percent no longer believe the election was stolen](https://thehill.com/homenews/media/3903299-one-fifth-of-fox-news-viewers-trust-network-less-after-dominion-lawsuit-revelations/). One in five(!!) of their viewers lost trust in one of the most socially destructive forces in the United States. Like die-hards of any ideology, many of them will remain committed to the Big Lie, but those numbers show that there is, in fact, a substantial persuadable margin among the network\'s own viewers.                          \n                 \n**Where we are now was best summarized by Crooked\'s own News & Politics contributor [Max Fisher](https://twitter.com/Max_Fisher/status/1648420743129214977?s=20): ""The trial may be settled, but the questions it would have raised—about media liability in an era of disinformation, about Fox\'s eroding power of the right—are not.""** [Dominion attorney Justin Nelson echoed that sentiment](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fox-news-dominion-voting-systems-lawsuit-settlement/), saying that while today is a victory, ""disinformation will not go away.""

The vote was 32-17 with two Republicans breaking with their colleagues to join all Democrats in opposition. The State House of Representatives still has to pass the bill (and is expected to) before it goes to Gov. Kim Reynolds (R-IA).

The governor said he was ""appalled and disheartened,"" and told the Washington Post in a statement: ""There is simply no place for such hateful rhetoric in the state of Oklahoma, especially by those that serve to represent the community through their respective office.
