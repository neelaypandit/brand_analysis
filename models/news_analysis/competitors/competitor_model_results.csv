Looking ahead to the second quarter, demand continues to be strong and industry capacity remains constrained, both of which are beneficial for unit revenue. Our core business is solid, and the team is doing an excellent job solving for the problems within our control, said Ted Christie , Spirit's President and Chief Executive Officer. Earlier this month, the Fort Lauderdale area experienced severe flash floods, requiring a 40-hour closure of the Fort Lauderdale airport. As a result of this weather event, Spirit canceled nearly 600 flights and diverted many others, disrupting travel plans for a substantial number of our Guests. Despite the significant and out-sized disruption to our network, our team was primed and ready to go on Friday morning once the airport re-opened. This quick recovery is a testament to the diligent efforts of our entire team as well as the innovative changes we have put in place to help accelerate recovery operations. The improvements we've made at Spirit to enhance the Guest experience and deliver high value are being recognized by many industry experts. In addition to Spirit being named the 'Value Airline of the Year' by Aviation Week Network's Air Transport World (ATW), last week WalletHub named Spirit the 'Most Affordable Airline' and No. 2 of 11 overall in its 2023 Best Airline Awards. I'm incredibly pleased and proud that the Spirit team is being recognized for their accomplishments. First Quarter 2023 Financial Results For the first quarter 2023, Spirit reported a net loss of 103.9 million , or a net loss of 0.95 per diluted share. Excluding special items, adjusted net loss for the first quarter 2023 was 89.4 million 1 , or an adjusted net loss of 0.82 per diluted share 1 . For the first quarter 2023, Spirit reported a pre-tax loss of 141.6 million and a pre-tax margin of negative 10.5 percent. Adjusted pre-tax loss for the first quarter was 120.6 million 1 and adjusted pre-tax margin was negative 8.9 percent 1 . Operations For the first quarter 2023, the Company's load factor was 80.8 percent. The Company experienced several adverse weather events across its network during the first quarter leading to a DOT on-time performance 2 of 69.4 percent and a DOT Completion Factor 2 of 98.3 percent. Excluding these weather-related and other uncontrollable events, the Company's controllable completion factor for the first quarter 2023 was 99.6 percent 5 . Revenue Total operating revenues for the first quarter 2023 were 1.3 billion , an increase of 39.5 percent compared to the first quarter 2022. Total revenue per ASM ( TRASM ) was 10.22 cents , up 23.9 percent compared to first quarter 2022 on 12.7 percent more capacity. This TRASM result was in-line with expectations provided in mid-March 2023 . On a per passenger flight segment basis, compared to the same period in 2022, total revenue per passenger flight segment ( segment ) for the first quarter 2023 increased 12.0 percent to 127.36 . Compared to the first quarter 2022, fare revenue per segment increased 16.8 percent to 57.45 and non-ticket revenue per segment increased 8.3 percent to 69.91 3 . Cost Performance Total GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter 2023 increased 24.0 percent compared to the first quarter 2022 to 1,462.2 million . Adjusted operating expenses for the first quarter 2023 increased 25.1 percent compared to the first quarter 2022 to 1,441.1 million 4 . Compared to the first quarter 2022, these increases were primarily driven by increased flight volume, additional aircraft, higher fuel prices and inflationary wage pressures. Compared to the guidance Spirit gave in mid-March 2023 , the Company's total operating expenses for the first quarter 2023 came in better-than-expected primarily due to a lower average fuel price per gallon for the quarter. Aircraft utilization in the first quarter 2023 was 11.2 hours, up 3.7 percent compared to the 10.8 hours in the same period of 2022 and a sequential improvement from the fourth quarter 2022 of 3.7 percent. For the second quarter 2023, we estimate our operating margin will range between 4.5 to 6.5 percent. In this demand environment, and with a declining fuel price in the second quarter of this year, the business at full utilization should be producing double digit operating margins. However, we continue to be hampered by NEO engine availability and pilot attrition issues that are preventing us from ramping up aircraft utilization. The NEO engine issues should improve as the year progresses but will likely remain a drag on utilization for the rest of the year. Also, pilot attrition levels have improved slightly from last year, but they are still volatile and they have not yet improved to the levels that we had hoped. Given these continued constraints, and our concerns about Air Traffic Control staffing, our capacity is heading towards to the lower end of our previous full year 2023 guide of 18 to 20 percent, said Scott Haralson , Spirit's Chief Financial Officer. We expect to be profitable for the remainder of the year with margins improving each quarter. We also expect our full year CASM ex-fuel to be around 7.0 cents . CASM ex-fuel should decline throughout the year as we improve efficiency with CASM ex-fuel in the fourth quarter 2023 being in the high 6's. Fleet Spirit took delivery of five new A320neo aircraft during the first quarter 2023 and retired four A319ceo aircraft. The Company ended the quarter with 195 aircraft in its fleet, an increase of 10.8 percent since the end of first quarter 2022. Liquidity and Capital Deployment Spirit ended first quarter 2023 with unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, short-term investment securities and liquidity available under the Company's revolving credit facility of 1.7 billion . Total capital expenditures for the three months ended March 31, 2023, were 86.0 million , primarily related to net outflows of aircraft pre-delivery deposits, expenditures related to the building of Spirit's new headquarters campus in Dania Beach, Florida and spare parts, including one spare engine.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company evaluates its financial performance utilizing various accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted operating expenses, Adjusted operating income (loss), Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted pre-tax income (loss), Adjusted pre-tax margin, Adjusted net income (loss), Adjusted provision (benefit) for income taxes, Adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share, Adjusted CASM and Adjusted CASM ex-fuel. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided as supplemental information to the financial information presented in this press release that is calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and these non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management believes that they supplement or enhance management's, analysts' and investors' overall understanding of the Company's underlying financial performance and trends and facilitate comparisons among current, past and future periods. Because the non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered superior to and are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP financial measures presented in the press release and may not be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in the method of calculation and in the items being adjusted. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. The information below provides an explanation of certain adjustments reflected in the non-GAAP financial measures and shows a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures reported in this press release (other than forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures) to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Within the financial tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Per unit amounts presented are calculated from the underlying amounts. The Company believes that adjusting for loss on disposal of assets and special charges is useful to investors because these items are not indicative of the Company's ongoing performance and the adjustments are similar to those made by our peers and allow for enhanced comparability to other airlines. Operating expenses per available seat mile ( CASM ) is a common metric used in the airline industry to measure an airline's cost structure and efficiency. We exclude aircraft fuel and related taxes and special items from operating expenses to determine Adjusted CASM ex-fuel. We also believe that excluding fuel costs from certain measures is useful to investors because it provides an additional measure of management's performance excluding the effects of a significant cost item over which management has limited influence and increases comparability with other airlines that also provide a similar metric.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to United's first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Yesterday, we issued our earnings release and investor update, which is available on our website ir.united.com. Information in yesterday's release and the remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represent the company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance. All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our earnings release, Form 10-K and 10-Q and other reports filed with the SEC by United Airlines Holdings and United Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors. Unless otherwise noted, we will be discussing our financial metrics on a non-GAAP basis on this call. Please refer to the related definitions and reconciliations in our press release. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release. Joining us on the call today to discuss our results and outlook are Chief Executive Officer, Scott Kirby; President, Brett Hart; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Nocella; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Gerry Laderman. In addition, we have other members of the executive team on the line available to assist with Q amp;A. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Scott. Scott Kirby — Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Kristina, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking the entire United team for delivering exceptional operation this quarter, given our hub geography, United almost all has the most flights impacted by weather, air traffic control delays of any US airline. But despite this in Q1, we had the lowest mainline flight and seat cancellation rates of any airline in the country. That's important not just for the obvious customer and brand impact, but it's also the key to hitting our planned capacity and CASM-ex target. I'm going to leave the detailed quarterly results and guidance to Gerry and Andrew, but today, I'll take a few minutes to talk about four emerging themes that have come to the foreground, and I think are important to the United investment case. One, there appears to be a clear change in seasonality that is causing peak leisure demand months, March through October to be even stronger, while months that were historically reliant on business demand are weaker, that particularly impacts January, February, and the first half of November and December. We believe demand is just structurally different than it was pre-pandemic, and we're still figuring out that new norm. Second, as we've expected all along, long-haul international is moving into the lead over domestic. Andrew will give more details, but this is a multi-year structural change based on aircraft retirements and pilot downgrades has essentially all long-haul US airlines around the world except United. But my third theme is an appropriately cautionary point, our guidance and everything we're discussing today is our base-case scenario based on what we're seeing right now. And what we're seeing right now is still strong demand. At airlines, the macroeconomic weakness is being offset with a counter-trend of consumer spending continuing to rebalance back to services. And, by the way, we still remain below our historical GDP relationship arguably indicating more room to run in the revenue recovery. However, it is clear that the macro risks are higher today than they were even a few months ago, as demonstrated by the banking scare with Silicon Valley Bank. We saw an immediate drop in close-in business demand that lasted for about two weeks, but now appears to have recovered. Our base-case, therefore, remains a mild recession or soft landing, which is consistent with what we're currently seeing in our bookings, but we agree that the tail risk is higher than normal, while we feel good about our 10 to 12 full year EPS. If the economy softens further, we prepare for it by A) having a lot of flexibility in the business line capacity if needed. B) improving our balance sheet to withstand a near-term issue with approximately 19 billion of liquidity and having reduced our total debt, including pension by 4.6 billion over the past 12 months. And C) this is actually my fourth theme, which is controlling what we can and hitting our CASM-ex target in this new, different and more challenging operating environment. We can't control what happens with the macro-economy, but we can and are doing a great job of controlling our costs. You can't run your airline like its 2019, it's different and harder now. Cancellation rates are the leading indicator of overcapacity and therefore CASM-ex, and United is leading the way on this front. Gerry will discuss some of the year-over-year tailwinds that will drive lower CASM-ex in the back-half of this year, but we only need CASM-ex to be approximately one point better in the second half of the year to hit our full-year target. We remain solidly on track. To wrap-up, over the last three years, our industry has confronted a rapidly changing environment. United hasn't been perfect, but we've got a lot more right than wrong. And on the big-picture, we've gotten it right and took the steps in the last three years to thrive in exactly this environment. International is stronger. The operating environment is more challenging, which means reliability is harder, but also had a premium for producing bottom line results. And we have confidence that our gauge growth and execution are keeping United uniquely on track for our near and long-term CASM-ex trajectory. That's not to say that there aren't real near-term risks, because we all know there are. But we feel really good about the strategic setup and tactical execution here at United. I want to again thank the entire United team for their hard work this quarter. We have a busy summer season ahead forward to achieving even more operational and financial records. With that, I'll turn it over to Brett. Brett J. Hart — President Thank you, Scott, and thank you to our United team for their hard work this quarter. As Scott mentioned, we continue to see the benefits of running a strong operation. In the first quarter, United led the industry with the lowest seat cancellation rate, despite around 20% of our flights being impacted by weather. The most out of any of our competitors. This was the first time since 2012 that we led on this metric. Additionally, United was first or second in the quarter for on-time departures at nearly all of our hub locations, including those heavily impacted by winter weather, like over here and Denver. Our airline is built to run well and recover fast and we expect our operation to reflect that through the peak summer season. We continue to navigate the challenges in the current operating environment, specifically, constrained industry infrastructure. United is working with the US Department of Transportation and FAA regarding operational disruptions in air traffic, staffing challenges. The FAA's decision to consider commercial air traffic with managing the growing number of space launches combined with the FAA recent move to give carriers more flexibility and how we all fly in and out of New York area airports shows that the FAA is listening to feedback and finding ways we can all work together. In March, we took steps to reduce our schedule in the New York region and DCA by around 30 daily departures over the summer period to provide the airspace relief requested by the FAA. The schedule reductions are largely regional jet focused and will be redeployed at our other hubs, minimizing the capacity impact to the system. It is our hope that this will drive improved customer experience, offline United in the New York area, and throughout our network. We're excited to announce that we reached a tentative agreement with our nearly 30,000 employees represented by the International Association of Machinists. With Boeing on the agreement expected to be completed by May 1st. We are very proud of the work that our team does daily to support our operation and create positive travel experience for our customers. Regarding other labor agreements, a new contract with our technicians, represented by the IBT ratified in January. We are still in active negotiations with our flight attendants, represented by the AFA and our pilots represented by ALPA. As a reminder, we reached an agreement with our dispatchers represented by ALPA last year. We look-forward to sharing further updates in the future. I once again want to thank our team for being the best in the industry. We remain confident in our outlook as we leverage our industry-leading operational performance and network advantages. And with that, I'll hand it over to Andrew to discuss the revenue numbers Phonetic . Andrew Nocella — Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer Thanks, Brett. First quarter top line revenues of 11.4 billion, finished consistent with our updated guidance of up 51% versus 2022. TRASM was up 22.5% year-over-year, while we were below our initial guidance, we expect that our TRASM performance in the first quarter will be top-tier. As expected, other revenues in the quarter, while strong, are growing at a slower rate than passenger revenues. The opposite trend we saw last year and over the course of the pandemic. While cargo revenue declined 37% year-over-year, it remains 39% above the same period in 2019. MileagePlus other revenue had yet another strong quarter and was up 25% year-over-year, driven by our strategic partnership with Chase. United's credit card continued to set records in Q1 including the highest first quarter ever for card spend, new accounts, up over 30% year-over-year and account attrition near historic lows. We also welcome Richard Nunn to the United team as the new CEO of MileagePlus. As Scott indicated, we believe we're seeing different revenue seasonality for the United network post-pandemic, and that change to impact our relative margin in Q1. New seasonality positively impacted March through October 2022, where new remote work schedule simulated business, particularly premium leisure. Ultimately, if these trends continue, we expect to be able to operate a more consistent level of capacity between March and October in future years. However, we believe the new seasonality negatively impacted Q1 in January or February, along with the first halves in November and December. With United's relatively small presence in the Caribbean and Florida where demand is usually strong in Q1 and over the winter months. The United network is more reliant on business traffic that is not fully recover to pre-pandemic volumes in these periods. United's global network and East-West trends are simply better aligned to March through October, post-pandemic where leisure and premium leisure business compensates for less traditional business traffic. As we head into Q2 2023, we are tracking ahead of 2022 in all the ways that we measure business traffic, a really good sign for revenue momentum. While it's still early on, we do see corporate business for May and June tracking well ahead of the previous months at this time. The business traffic rebound we're seeing is strongest in global long-haul markets, where a video conference is not a substitute for an in-person meeting. The recent banking scare did initiate a slowdown in demand across multiple customer types in the quarter. Impact on business demand for domestic line was the most significant, impact on domestic leisure was smaller and impact over on overall international demand was actually minimal. In the weeks after the scare, we saw business demand relative to the same period of 2019, declined by 8 points after steady progress experienced to the quarter to that point. This trend has since reversed back to pre-banking scare levels. In Q2, we expect total revenue to be up 14% to 16% versus the second quarter of 2022 with capacity up approximately 18.5%. Our expectations for revenue in the second quarter continued to show strength with approximately 8% to 10% growth in domestic revenues and almost 30% for international. Second quarter bookings and revenues do look good versus the same point in 2022 with booked deals up 13% and 31% above 2019, respectively. For 2023, we expect to expand international flying by approximately twice the rate of domestic leaning into the favorable supply-demand balance that we expect. We'll be focused on extending United's leading position across the Atlantic and Asia and the South Pacific. We believe this capacity deployment plan will set us up to meet our financial objectives given the stronger revenue outlook we are seeing for international flying and the rebound in Polaris Cabin. We will also pass two critical milestones by this summer with all United international wide-body jets having the latest generation Polaris seat and a premium plus cabin. While further return to corporate business will help profitability in all quarters, we're not assuming that will occur in our 2023 revenue outlook. United scheduled capacity this summer is up 39% in the Atlantic, but industry capacity excluding United is estimated to be down about 1%. United will operate an average of 207 daily flights across the Atlantic this summer. Across the Pacific, United plans to be up 14% excluding China with industry capacity down about 7% both versus 2019. Overall, international ASMs will be 46% of United's capacity this summer versus 43% in 2019. Yesterday, we announced another set of capacity increases to the South Pacific ideally time for the Southern summer later this year. These include the first-ever non-stop service from San Francisco to Christchurch and new service from Los Angeles to Auckland in partnership with Air New Zealand and to Los Angeles to Brisbane, we will connect to our new partner Virgin Australia. Rebuilding connectivity back to our original 2019 standards in our Mid-Con hubs in Dallas will also be a long-term focus for our domestic line. The loss of regional jets during the pandemic without mainline jets to backfill them cause connectivity to suffer. Peak bank sizes at our high flow hubs are down 10% to 20% versus 2019. We were able to build connectivity and margins in 2018 and 2019 when we increased bank size connectivity, and we expect to execute a similar strategy in 2023 and 2024. However, this time around, we'll do it with the appropriately sized 737 jets instead of single-class regional jets. As requested by the FAA, we've reduced our planned flights from New York City this summer, including two and from Newark. We believe this will be the first time in years that Newark will operate within the airport's capacity abilities in most hours and consistent with the slot allocations. We're optimistic that between the new terminals and capacity consistent with the runway's capabilities, the customer experience will improve dramatically, and we appreciate the partnership with the FAA to make this happen. United will gain up to 17 new mainline gates in Terminal A and Newark this summer versus 2022, which will improve Newark's reliability and customer experience. Along with the new Newark gates, we will open a new United Club in Terminal A and in Terminal C later this year, adding 38,000 square feet and will be up 161% in club space relative to 2019. As impressive as that club space measurement as in Newark, our club members in Denver will experience an opening of three United Clubs over the next year that include a total of 97,000 square feet, a 149% increase versus 2019. Construction of our new gates in Denver is also almost complete and will have 90 gates up from 66 we had in 2019, which we expect will allow us to dramatically increase bank sizes and connectivity in 2024 and 2025. At United, we remain focused on our high ground, structural strengths focused on global long haul, correcting connectivity issues in our Mid-Con hubs that surfaced during the pandemic and, of course, gauge, increases that are consistent with our large hub markets. Our capacity plan for this year remains in place without adjustment as we operate with strong operational results. With that, I wanted to say thanks to the entire United team, and I'll turn it over to Gerry. Gerald Laderman — Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Andrew, and good morning to everyone. Let's start with our first quarter results. Our pretax loss of 256 million was in line with expectations and at the better end of our updated guidance issued last month. We saw losses in January and February due to seasonal weakness, but March turned solidly profitable. Our first quarter fuel price of 3.33 came in at the lower end of our revised guidance range. This was still about 0.14 higher than our expectation at the start of the quarter due to a spike in jet fuel prices in late January and early February. Turning to non-fuel costs. Our first quarter CASM-ex came in slightly better than our revised guidance range at down 0.1% versus the first quarter last year. Our operational performance in the first quarter was truly exceptional and our CASM-ex fee is largely due to the cost benefit of a reliable operation. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately 19 billion in liquidity. We continue to leverage the flexibility provided by our cash with financing opportunities and paying down debt. We generated over 3 billion in operating cash flow in the first quarter, the highest for any quarter in United's history, and we produced free cash flow of over 1 billion. Over the last 12 months, our total debt, including pension liability has declined by approximately 4.6 billion, and we remain on track to meet our 2023 target of adjusted net debt-to-adjusted EBITDAR of less than 3 times. Looking ahead, we expect second quarter CASM-ex to be flat to up 2%, with capacity up approximately 18.5% both versus the second quarter of last year. Strong cost performance underpins our confidence in the earnings trajectory of the business in the second quarter, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of 3.50 to 4, with a fuel price of 2.80 to 3. As noted in our investor update, this fuel price is based on prices as of April 12. As others mentioned, our strong operational performance in the first quarter sets the tone for the remainder of the year and is key to our conviction in achieving our CASM-ex targets. For the full year, we continue to be on track to keep CASM-ex approximately flat versus 2022 with non-fuel unit costs in the second half of this year declining versus the second half of last year. To give context as to why we expect CASM-ex in the second half of this year to improve on a year-over-year basis versus the first half of this year, it's helpful to consider the 2022 cost baseline. With COVID still significantly impacting the business in the first half of last year, we have certain unique headwinds in the first half of this year when comparing costs on a year-over-year basis. Here are two notable examples. Revenue in the first half of 2022 was much lower than the second half of 2022, which meant that distribution costs were also much lower in the first half of last year versus the second half. This drives the year-over-year comparisons for the first half of this year to be commensurately higher than the second half of this year. A similar phenomenon exists with maintenance expense. As Omicron abated and the recovery took hold, we ramped up our maintenance activity in the back half of '22 to more normalized levels. Again, the difference in year-over-year costs are much more muted in the second half of this year versus the first half. So simply put, the two items represent a 1 to 2 point CASM-ex headwind in the first half of this year, which won't exist in the second half. These drivers, along with strategic cost management, gauge growth and running a reliable operation support our expectation that we will hit our flat CASM-ex target for the year. When combined with our revenue outlook, we remain confident in our trajectory towards 10 to 12 in adjusted diluted EPS for the full year, whether we face a mild recession or soft landing. As we have left the starting gate for our United Next plan, I'm encouraged by the progress we've made not only financially but in our operation and across the entire organization. While we continue to live in uncertain times, I know that we will successfully manage everything under our control as we continue on a path to reach our full year financial objectives. And with that, I will turn it over to Kristina for the Q amp;A. Kristina Munoz — Director Investor Relations Thank you, Gerry. We will now take questions from the analyst community. Please limit yourself to one question and if needed, one follow-up question. Phyllis, please describe the procedure to ask a question. Questions and Answers Operator Thank you. Operator Instructions The first question comes from Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs. Your line is unmuted. Please go ahead. Catherine O'Brien — Goldman Sachs — Analyst Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time. So there's been a lot of investor concern recently around the domestic slowdown. So I think I'll just get right to that. I know United is built to win the international strength. But can you just help us think about what's driving the domestic unit revenue performance to underperform international, at least based on first quarter versus '19. Is there a shift in leisure demand to international from domestic that might be exaggerated right now post pandemic? That international business is stronger, as you know, prepared remarks, something else? And then I saw you had another record first quarter build in the air traffic liability. Would also be helpful just to talk through how much you have on the books, domestic versus international first quarter? Thanks so much. Andrew Nocella — Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer Sure, Catherine. We're getting this question about domestic strength a lot and we should really address it. The way when we go back thinking about it, how to describe the conditions of this Q2, we have to recall Q2 of last year, Q2 of 2022 was the best domestic TRASM quarter ever for United which RASM up 25% versus Q2 of 2019, which, by the way, was a prior record holder. We simply sent a really hard comp for Q2 2023. And also last year at this time, international markets were not widely open to travelers, in my view, selected domestic trips out of caution, just creating unprecedented demand relative to the number of seats available to sell. This year's conditions are different. International travel is more or less completely open, and we see customers clearly excited about taking a long-haul trip. Domestic capacity is also now comparable to 2019 levels. So here are the facts, domestic ASMs at United will be up about 10% in Q2 2023 year-over-year. And our TRASM outlook for domestic will be negative low single digits from what I've said today. Total domestic revenue should finish well above 2022, given our TRASM outlook on capacity growth of about 10%. We're currently booked about 10% ahead in gross revenue at this point compared to last year, and we're about 54% into the booking curve for the quarter. I just don't see these facts as weak when revenue is on target to again break the record and TRASM is likely to be just a bit behind an amazingly strong 2022. In summary, when Q2 2023 is in the books, we will likely be our second biggest best domestic TRASM quarter ever with record total domestic revenues. The only thing negative, I think I can say is that as good as domestic looks, it's just not matching global long-haul revenue outlook, which is very strong and where United has focused a majority of capacity. Catherine O'Brien — Goldman Sachs — Analyst And on ATL? Andrew Nocella — Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer And on the ATL, I think it's seasonally moving in a normal way. I don't know, Gerry wants to add anything else on the ATL question. Gerald Laderman — Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Cathy, your question about international versus domestic, you're actually the first person to ask us that question. So we'll follow up with you. Catherine O'Brien — Goldman Sachs — Analyst Okay. Thank you. Operator The next question comes from Jamie Baker from J.P. Morgan. Your line is unmuted. Please go ahead. Jamie Baker — J.P. Morgan — Analyst Hey, good morning, everybody. Just chuckling it Gerry's response to Cathy there. On the ATL, Gerry, the build obviously helped with free cash flow generation in the quarter, presumably, the ATL will incrementally moderate in the second half as it often does. Do you still think you can cover this year's 9 billion in capex and generate positive free cash flow? Gerald Laderman — Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes, Jamie, I think we can. Jamie Baker — J.P. Morgan — Analyst Okay. Fair enough. Second to Andrew, relative to the international component, you've got a lot of new route activity. Could you speak to sort of like same-store sales or same-store RASM or revenue, I guess, relative to those new routes? And how does the ramp to profitability in all of these new markets compared to that in the past? I mean, are new markets maturing much faster? Or does it take about the same amount of time as it ever did? I'm just trying to think about the read-through as some of these trends normalize next year. Andrew Nocella — Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer Yeah. There's — for global long haul, there is virtually no school up right now, Jamie. It gives us — the supply-demand equation is just not what it's ever been in the past. While United supply across the Atlantic and Pacific is dramatically up and we're happy it is dramatically up, obviously. Industry flies down. So what I would tell you is that the new routes come in very quickly with very strong profitability, which is why we keep adding them. That being said, in terms of same-store sales, I will say that London Heathrow is probably our weakest at this point because there's just — that there is a large amount of capacity in London Heathrow relative to the rest of the world, and we've grown there. And our connections within Europe in our key hubs are — have not fully recovered, just like they haven't domestically. And so we actually do see some relative weakness in certain parts of the global network off of a strong base. But the new routes to your question are just coming in with home runs on day one. Jamie Baker — J.P. Morgan — Analyst Thank you gentlemen for the answers. Take care. Operator The next question comes from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Your line is unmuted. Please go ahead. Conor Cunningham — Melius Research — Analyst Hi, everyone. Thank you. Just the 2023 CASM-ex rate seems pretty encouraging. I know you mentioned maintenance and distribution as being a main driver from the first half to second half, but it still seems to me that you're holding incremental cost. I mean, that may be the cost of doing business right now. But just curious if you could talk about what potentially rolls off next year as we start to think about CASM-ex there? Thank you. Andrew Nocella — Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer So I'm not sure I would call it rolling off. But keep in mind, next year, one of the benefits we're really going to start seeing is that growth in mainline gauge, as the aircraft continue to come in. That process is really just starting this year. So next year, we get the full run rate of the larger gauge aircraft and take even more next year. So when you're looking sort of where the tailwinds are next year gauges one. And the comps year-over-year are going to be better. Think of this year is really finally getting to the run rate of the post-COVID sort of full operation. So I think as an industry, we're done with a lot of the surprises we all kind of saw coming out of COVID with some of the cost pressures. So I think from the cost side, the business has become more stable and a little more predictable. Conor Cunningham — Melius Research — Analyst Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the evolving booking curve and seasonality that you've been talking about. Just curious how your compact going to combat those challenges going forward? I mean Delta has mentioned they're talking about looking at like overbooking and like incurring with the inventory. Just curious what the strategy is at United, if there is one to combat those changes in the booking curve? Thank you. Andrew Nocella — Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer Sure. Well, we think we clearly have the best RM system in the world, by the way. That's what it'll start off with. While there's been a small change in the number of tickets not flown in the quarter, due to the increased flexibility created when United eliminated change fees. It's our view that it's not really material and it's fully accounted for by our RM systems. And I'll add on to that, our no-show rate is lower as well, and we will not be changing our overbooking levels at this point. Conor Cunningham — Melius Research — Analyst Okay. Thank you. Operator The next question comes from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is unmuted. Please go ahead. Savanthi Syth — Raymond James — Analyst Hey, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just a question on the MAX deliveries. It looks like you had three more deliveries than the prior plan in 1Q, but for the full year, kind of slipped a little bit. Just curious how you're feeling about confidence on kind of the MAX deliveries, especially given the recent news? Gerald Laderman — Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Okay. Savi, from what we know on the recent news, we don't think that's going to have much of an impact on us, certainly won't have an impact on second quarter and what — and I think you may have seen this yourself, is Boeing has gotten back on track on delivering aircraft. The issues that they had over the prior few years, they've really managed well. And the impact from what we know today for the full year just will be minor. Savanthi Syth — Raymond James — Analyst Okay. That's helpful, Gerry. And maybe along those lines, a follow-up on the fuel efficiency, there's a little kind of surprised by kind of what we saw here in the first quarter, maybe a little bit less than what we've seen last year. What's your expectation around how that trends kind of going forward, especially kind of given that, that's another part of the kind of the cost benefit in the United Next Plan? Gerald Laderman — Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Well, as we start seeing more and more of the MAXs, we'll start seeing that improvement that we've sort of talked about on United Next. Remember, we've just started taking delivery of those — those incremental aircraft. And there'll be a nice pop in that as well once the MAX 10 delivers at some point. Savanthi Syth — Raymond James — Analyst So just from a critical mass standpoint, when does that — when do you think roughly that is based on like what you know today, I guess? Gerald Laderman — Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. It starts to kick in next year, critical mass, maybe the year after. Savanthi Syth — Raymond James — Analyst Okay. It's very helpful. Thank you. Gerald Laderman — Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer I'm just going to see the trend quarter-by-quarter. Operator The next question comes from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is unmuted. Please go ahead. Michael Linenberg — Deutsche Bank — Analyst Hi, good morning. I — when I look at your sort of loads from fourth quarter to March quarter, I mean, you can see that seasonal hit. And Andrew, when I saw that I sort of thought maybe it had to do with a higher no-show rate, but you sort of just addressed that, that is not an issue. As you add more service to places like New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Brazil, etc., does that — we should see improvement in that, right? Maybe you never actually are able to get to the level of, say, American or Delta from a seasonal perspective. But to some extent, you should be able to mitigate that as we think about the seasonality. Is that — is that kind of where we're headed? Do we see that really start to narrow versus the industry? Andrew Nocella — Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer It's a good question. And our intent is to get it to narrow. But we do — we're simply smaller in Florida due to a lot of reasons that that can't be addressed in a matter of a few quarters, we have to be addressed over years. And so while our goal is to narrow that gap in Q1, I don't think to be blunt, we're going to be able to eliminate it. Clearly, the introduction of counter-seasonal fly into the South Pacific definitely helps put it in the right direction, and we'll be looking for more opportunities and we'll be looking to grow Florida, I think, faster than probably most of our competitors because we're just so relatively small. But ultimately, I do think Q1 is going to continue to be our weakest quarter and a recovery of business traffic in Q1 will do the most to help our relative Q1 results. Michael Linenberg — Deutsche Bank — Analyst Okay. Thanks. And then just sort of as a follow-on and tied to that. When you look at the announcement that you did make yesterday, I mean it's — it seems like it's going to need a decent amount of additional capacity. And when I look at your fleet this year, I think you took two 78s in the March quarter, it does not look like we're going to see any more widebodies coming in. How are you funding a lot of that new service later this year, should we assume that maybe it's going to — China is not going to come back as much? Are you going to pull from other parts of the operation? I'm just trying to figure out where you're going to get the aircraft because some of these routes require more than one airplane just to do daily round trip service? Andrew Nocella — Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer It's definitely was quite a few aircraft heading towards the South Pacific. What I would tell you is that we just seasonally reduced Europe and we would otherwise, but many of those widebodies into our domestic system. And this year, our maintenance. And this year, those aircraft will be flying to the South Pacific, which we think is their best use. In regards to China, we continue to be stuck at four flights per week. We are preparing to supply more than that, but have been unable to get that done so far. But hopefully, later this year, we will be flying more to China, and we have the aircraft to do so if the conditions are — allow us to do so. Michael Linenberg — Deutsche Bank — Analyst Great. Thank you. Operator The next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is unmuted. Please go ahead. Duane Pfennigwerth — Evercore ISI — Analyst Hey, good morning. I wanted to ask about one of the themes Scott started the call with on flexibility. And maybe a follow-up to Mike's question just there. But first on seasonal shaping capacity. Given the new normal, is there a greater emphasis recently on seasonally shaping capacity? And how does maybe lack of regional lift or lack of ability to kind of flex up on regionals limit your ability to do that, if at all? Andrew Nocella — Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer It's a really good question. And I am hopeful that after further evidence that we'll be able to operate a more stable schedule all the way from March through the end of October, which I think will definitely benefit our cost structure having less of the peak. However, we are not there just yet. I think we need to make it through this year. We need to see how the remote work schedules continue to play out. We need to, in particular, see how this September and this October do, they were fantastic, obviously, last year. And I think that will help us validate for next year whether we actually change the seasonal shape in, as I just described. And hopefully, we can. But we're not ready to really jump into the deep end of that pool today. So we will continue to peak the airline in July as we normally do, and we'll see where we go from there. In terms of regional jets, the lack of regional jets has definitely hurt our connectivity. This is an issue. I talked about it, and we're very focused on rebuilding that connectivity with the right jets going forward. And in fact, we don't intend to ever go back to the fleet of approximately 600 regional jets we had in 2019. We think the economics have changed. We think the business has changed and we need to change with it. That being said, on the good news front, the regional jet pilot situation has recently, in our mind, stabilized. We're no longer losing pilots at the same rate we were earlier — very early this year or last year. And the production of block hours in our regional jet division at the end of this year will be consistent with the production of block hours that we started the year with. And I can tell you that our original budget for that was not that. We thought we would continue to see deterioration. So the good news there is the regional jets are going to be able to at least temporarily help us boost our connectivity as we wait for all of our mainline jets from Boeing to deliver over the next two or so years. Duane Pfennigwerth — Evercore ISI — Analyst Thanks, Andrew, for that detail. And then just sticking with the flexibility theme on capacity and the idea that you could kind of take capacity lower if the environment warranted. How much lower could you take it, I guess, relative to the high teens, 20% in the back half? And just conceptually, are we solving for margins this year? Or are we solving for CASM? Thank you for taking the questions. Andrew Nocella — Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer I don't think we're ever solving for CASM. We're solving for margin and, of course, the 10% Phonetic to 12% Phonetic . So that will always be our focus. And we're going to maintain the flexibility. Like I said, I'm pretty bullish about the international environment, and that's going to generate the large lion's share of our ASM growth this year. And I expect international would be strong all the way through the end of October. And so far, chose that. It's still early, obviously, when we look at that far, but we're very optimistic. And domestically, Gerry set us up at a really good fleet plan where we have a significant number of older A320 and A319 aircraft that we could easily fly less or we could put on the ground if we thought that was necessary as we solve to reach the right margin and right EPS targets that we have for the year. Duane Pfennigwerth — Evercore ISI — Analyst Thanks for the thoughts. Operator The next question comes from Helane Becker from Cowen. Your line is unmuted. Please go ahead. Helane Becker — Cowen and Company — Analyst Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody. Thank you for the time. Two questions. One, did you say what pension contribution would be this year? And if not, could you? And then the other question I had was just on United Next and where you are in '23 versus the plan? And what progress is on maybe some of the bigger items. I think you just addressed Andrew, the regional jet and the narrow-body shift in mix, but maybe connecting smaller cities or connecting bank changes or something like that? Thanks. Gerald Laderman — Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Hey, Helane, yeah, we did not say anything about pension. Nothing's changed from our recent disclosures. There is — we expect no pension contributions this year. Our pensions are in good shape and both with the pension calculations that can be made and interest rates having nicely reduced the liabilities. We wouldn't expect any pension contributions actually for a couple of years. Helane Becker — Cowen and Company — Analyst That's great to know. Andrew Nocella — Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer On the United Next comment, as I've indicated a bit earlier, my number one focus domestically is this connectivity issue. We can clearly see it when we look at our RASM by flight by market that we are just — we're missing a lot of connectivity relative to where we were. And so as we go forward, we're going to be very focused on rebuilding that connectivity and getting the bank sizes back to where they were, hopefully, in 2019, but it is going to take some time. But we're optimistic just like we did it in 2017 and 2018. And that we're going to do it again, and it's going to be very accretive to margin profitability and, of course, to RASM as we build back the connectivity. So it is a really important focus of our domestic flying, and we're ready to get that implemented as soon as possible. Helane Becker — Cowen and Company — Analyst That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator The next question comes from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is unmuted. Please go ahead. Ravi Shanker — Morgan Stanley — Analyst All right. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I think despite the kind of tough macro outlook, pretty clear what you guys are expecting that things are fine for now, but there's high probability of a tail risk event. Can you help us with kind of what data points you're looking at to determine if these tail risks are either receding or materializing? Are these kind of airline specific data points or these broader macro data points into the latter kind of — where are some of those data points you're tracking? Andrew Nocella — Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer Well, maybe I'll start and talk about it from a business traffic recovery and what we're seeing in there because I do think one of the most common questions I get is business traffic recovering and what is it going to look like. And first of all, I wonder whether the old methods of measuring business travel will be the same in the future. But for now, it's all we really have to really benchmark against 2019. I will say that as we look at business traffic three different ways. The first is from larger corporations that have a contract with United. The second from a set of demand is from agencies that specialize in business traffic, and the third is based on ticket attributes. The third is clearly the most encompassing view as it includes small and medium-sized businesses that don't have an agency or don't have a contract for United. So in Q4, the revenue recovery rate was between 70% and 85% for these three categories. In Q1, the revenue recovery rate for these three measurements range from 85% to 97%. And for the first two weeks of April, the recovery ranged from 95% to 101%. I think this data in the last two weeks of April was a surprise to us as we've seen more conservative measurements, start to approach 100%. And the fact that large corporations are getting close to 100% is a nice tailwind to United. As many of you know, this is critically important — critically important component to our revenues. I'll also say that the recovery in global long-haul business is a few points of head of domestic. And all these measurements are just a good sign that our planned international revenue increases, our capacity increases are moving in the right direction. We obviously need more time to see if this trend will hold. But what I can tell you in the last week or so after reviewing this data become a lot more positive even as many of the headlines continue to predict a recession. As I said in my opening statement, the trends for May look ahead of March. I can also confirm in absolute dollars the last 14 days have been the best booking days for business traffic revenue that we've seen since the pandemic. I'll also add, since this step-up in business demand is very recent, we've not incorporated it into our revenue outlook for the quarter. Ravi Shanker — Morgan Stanley — Analyst That's incredibly helpful. Thank you for the color there. And since my follow-up question was going to be about SMB versus enterprise corporate. I'll switch it up and ask you about the cargo business. Obviously, a small portion of the business, it probably very volatile given that there was one of the bigger kind of pandemic era winners. How are you seeing that evolve through '23 and '24? And what's the normalized level there? Andrew Nocella — Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer Yeah. So I mean, cargo stepped down in Q1 and stepped down exactly with our plan, still well ahead of 2019, which is nice to see. But we are seeing very low prices, low yields across the system, particularly outside of United. We've been — I think we've done a great job of holding yields where they're at through our — really the best cargo team in the world in my opinion. But not only is air freight challenges now, but also seafreight where rates are incredibly low. So we're holding our own. I think, again, we're executing consistent with our plan, and we've got this baked in for the rest of the year. We do expect to see more and more pressure on cargo yields going forward. But the United team is executing in an amazing way. Our relative size to our primary competitors, you can see it in the numbers. And so I'm still actually bullish about the business relative to 2019. But look, it's last Q1 in particular, we reached an unbelievable high based on where we were with the pandemic and COVID, we didn't expect we would be able to re-achieve that number, and we didn't. But again, we're on plan. Ravi Shanker — Morgan Stanley — Analyst Okay. Thank you. Operator The next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Your line is unmuted. Please go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu — Jefferies — Analyst Good morning, everyone, and thank you. Scott, I wanted to ask you maybe a cost question. You've been fairly up spoken about airlines needing more employees for the same level of operations. And your ASMs per employee are now just 3% below 2019 versus 6% to 7% in the second half of '22. And presumably, there's some advanced hiring as you're preparing for new aircraft. Is there room to further close the gap versus 2019 on this basis as we think about ASM mix and new aircraft deliveries? Scott Kirby — Chief Executive Officer Well, I guess we'll see. But I feel really good about what we've done with running with higher resources than we did pre-pandemic, it's leading to the best operation that any one of the countries run the best operation, frankly, that we've ever run. That's great for our customers. That's great for our brand. I also think it's turning out at least right now in this environment to be the lowest CASM outcome that by being able to run a reliable operation, most Indecipherable and being able to run a reliable operation is what is giving us the best CASM results in the industry and given us confidence about CASM results going forward. So I think we're at the right place at the moment. It's obviously very — if the operating environment gets easier down the road, it's obviously easy to adjust that, especially as we're growing just slip in hiring for a month or two and you're right back to where you were. So easy to adjust, but I feel I'm really proud of how the team has done operationally. And I think it has been the lowest CASM outcome we could have had by running reliable operations. Sheila Kahyaoglu — Jefferies — Analyst And if I could just ask a question about your premium performance, which was pretty good. Premium relative to 2019, up 25% compared to total domestic up 5%. Can you break that out in any sort of way, whether it's RASM or yield performance? How we should think about the continued growth there? Andrew Nocella — Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer Sure. I mean, I've been really happy actually with our progress on the premium side in all of our cabins, particularly for Polaris. We've been just making a ton of progress in the Polaris Cabin given the rebound in business traffic, but we still have more to come. In March, for example, our load factor was up 10 points year-over-year and 5 points versus 2019. We sold a lot of seats, but we sold business travel seats accounted for 7 points down year-over-year and premium leisure comp traffic compensated for that by being up 7 points. So it just to offset it, but that came at a lower yield. So we're carefully also trying to keep increased premium leisure demand and revenue created since the pandemic while accommodating more and more of traditional business traffic. There are lots of puts and takes with this given our load factors, but we do think that there's potential to get this done, particularly as we continue to integrate the new 737s, which come into our fleet with a large amount of premium seating. Most of our growth is tilted towards premium seating at this point, particularly as we retire the single class regional jets from the network. And so I will say that I think we're just hitting on all cylinders on this front and the progress we're seeing in Polaris in particular, with higher load factors, backfilling temporarily lease or premium leisure. And ultimately, as long-haul business traffic, as I said earlier, coming back faster, we were optimistic that we're going to get Polaris completely back to where it was in terms of relative profitability margin later this year. Sheila Kahyaoglu — Jefferies — Analyst Thank you. Operator The next question comes from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Your line is unmuted. Please go ahead. Scott Group — Wolfe Research — Analyst Hey, thanks, good morning. So when I look at domestic capacity for the second quarter, it's back below 2019 levels. It's only up marginally from Q1, which is a lot less than normal. I guess, is this that — when you go back to the plan from the beginning of the year, is this a change in how you're thinking about domestic capacity? Is this a sort of a one-off quarter? Or is this more of a multi-quarter, more prolonged view of domestic capacity? Andrew Nocella — Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer I do think it is a little bit lower than Q1. I think you're absolutely correct on that. It's where the numbers shook out. We clearly leaned as hard as we could — as quickly as we could into global long haul, which really turns on in March and April, and that's what shook out for domestic because we thought that was the best place to put the capacity. But you should see a little bit more domestic ASM growth in the second half than what we're seeing in the second quarter. Scott Group — Wolfe Research — Analyst Okay. And then I know it's early. You talked about next year, another focus on mainline gauge. Any early preliminary thoughts on how you're thinking about overall capacity growth in '24? Andrew Nocella — Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer I don't think we're prepared to give our guidance for '24. We're excited to continue implementing United Next. And most importantly, for domestic we were excited to make sure that we rebuild the connectivity as quickly as we can back to where we were pre-pandemic. And I think that's our biggest driver of domestic RASM next year and that's really all I can say at this point. Scott Group — Wolfe Research — Analyst Okay. Thank you. Operator The next question comes from David Vernon from Bernstein. Your line is unmuted. Please go ahead. David Vernon — Bernstein — Analyst Hey, thanks\\, guys. Thanks for fitting me in here. Two questions for you guys on the new seasonality. Andrew, can you maybe talk a little bit more about some of the short-term challenges and opportunities you're dealing with from a revenue management perspective, things like overbooking and how you're sort of managing yields with this sort of shift in customer behavior, which seems relatively new? And then, Scott, I'd love to get your long-term perspective on what do you think United might need to do a little bit differently if we're going to be relying more on the leisure market, things like do you still get the same bang for the buck out of like a Polaris launch, for example, if this shift continues longer term? Thank you. Andrew Nocella — Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer Sure. What I would say is the booking curves have adjusted. They're both international and domestic are booking further out. International more extreme than domestic. And so we are — our RM systems have adjusted for this very, very quickly, and we're booked ahead in our global long-haul system based on the change in the booking curve. Domestic has also moved out. There's, I think, 4 points greater outside of 21 days and there is inside of 21 days right now. And again, RM systems have adjusted for that. That being said, we are managing to keep yield domestically as close as possible to where we were last year. And as we look at this, we expect we're going to run lower load factors in our domestic entity in Q2 as a result. That's part of our plan. We think it's the right strategy. And we do think we'll be able to fill up some of these seats were closer in higher yield in business. And the back that business has had significant recent recovery in the last two weeks makes me even more bullish that we've executed the right strategy there and that we do have capacity available to accommodate closer in business demand to the extent it materializes in Q2. Scott Kirby — Chief Executive Officer And on the longer term, it's an interesting question. First, I think I wouldn't conclude that business — we'll see what happens with business demand. In the near term, though, the most obvious things we can do are the things that are happening in revenue management. Andrew talked about, we have the best revenue management system and team in the industry. That is true. We made huge investments coming into the pandemic, concluded it during the pandemic. and the team is just really like none of these things, they're generally not that surprising. We didn't really appreciate fully seasonality shift, but the revenue management system is working well. And that's one of the obvious places Andrew talked also about pivoting the network. It's another one that straightforward things to do, fly more to Florida, a lot more leisure destinations. In terms of things like Polaris Class, Andrew also talked about the fact that while we have less business traffic flying internationally, we have a lot more premium leisure. So I wouldn't anticipate, at least in the near term, any radical shifts in the strategy and mostly probably come in terms of capacity deployment, more than anything which one could Indecipherable fungible assets is that that relatively easy for us to do. Operator We will now switch to the media portion of the call. Operator Instructions The first question comes from Claire Buchi Phonetic . Your line is unmuted. Please go ahead. Claire Buchi — — Analyst Hi, I wanted to ask about summer operations. You mentioned cutting flights in New York earlier in the call. I wanted to ask about what other operational changes United is making this summer to avoid a repeat of the disruptions of last summer? Torbjorn J. Enqvist — Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer Hey, Claire, this is Toby. Well, we've done a lot. Let's talk about Newark and New York first. So we work with FAA. FAA gave us a waiver for the summer. So we are down about 30 flights per day in Newark and at peak times that's going to make a big difference. Also, like Andrew said, we are not the only one. So for the first time in a long while in New York, we actually will be scheduled to on a blue sky day, at least what the capacity of the airport can actually hold. So we're really bullish on that. And on top of that, and Andrew mentioned this in his remarks as well, we're actually going to have 17 new normal mainline gates in the brand new terminal A in Newark. And if you guys haven't been there, it's a fantastic terminal. I mean it's a world-class terminal replacing a 1969 Indecipherable terminal that we were in last year. So just right up the bat right there, that's going to be a huge improvement. The other thing, again, United actually did, if you guys remember, we actually did pretty well last year, last summer. I think the biggest issues we had was actually the infrastructure, especially in the Transatlantic. And now actually, we're just in Europe two weeks ago and talked to our biggest airports, they're Heathrow, Frankfurt and Munich. And they are one year ahead of all the hiring and all the other things there. So again, it's summer, it's peaked up. It's not going to be perfect, but we are in a much, much, much better place than we were last year and we reached a Indecipherable I mean all the terminals in Europe is actually open this year. We had large terminals in Europe last year, both in Amsterdam and Heathrow and others that wasn't even open, and they are wide open and open for business this year. So we're — again, we're — we call it summer readiness. We are not taking it lightly. Summer is our Super Bowl, is the toughest time to operate. It's going to have some tough days surely with weather and things, but we're going to be in a much, much better place than we were last year. Claire Buchi — — Analyst I just — Delta said that they were flying less than they had expected. They were trying to reduce the turnaround time for maintenance on aircraft. Is there just any of that detail that you can share with us? Brett J. Hart — President Well, I would just — I'll take that, too. We've already done that. So when we talk about we're not building our own like it's 2019, we built those buffers in prospectively and in advance. And that's why we ran the best operation in the country because we were ahead of the curve. And perhaps others are catching up to that, but we were ahead of that curve, and that's what led to the best operation in the country in the first quarter. Claire Buchi — — Analyst Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Leslie Josephs. Your line is unmuted. Please go ahead. Leslie Josephs — CNBC — Analyst Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just curious on the retrofits, how many of those do you expect to get this year and how many were you expecting before? And what was the outlook for 2024? And then it's been almost seven years since you've launched Polaris and just curious if you are and how are you thinking about kind of the successor to that? Andrew Nocella — Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer Okay. That's a good question, and I will not answer the latter question other than the teams are always working on innovations at United across all of our business functions. And I'm sure somebody somewhere is working on something great when it comes to seats and we'll leave it at that. In regards to retrofits, and I don't have the numbers here. We'll have somebody call you back. But the reality is the supply challenges across the board whether it be IFE systems, chips, seats and many other things are just more challenging than they've ever been in our business. And while we converted our first A319 a few weeks ago, it should be flying hopefully any day now in the new interior, and we have multiple lines that we'll be doing this summer. So you'll see a rapid increase in the number of aircraft with the signature interior through retrofits and through new aircraft. The total time to convert all the aircraft is just going to be longer than we expected, unfortunately, probably by a year or two, to be frank. So we will get there. It will just take a little bit longer than we had originally intended. But you'll see material progress. We'll get some of the numbers out to you separately by the end of this year. Leslie Josephs — CNBC — Analyst And do you expect that to hurt your revenue premium at all for people that are booking up or choosing United because it has those features? Andrew Nocella — Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer No, what I would tell you is that the increasing of to getting on an aircraft, the United signature interior is going to go up rapidly. It's just the tail of this is going to take a little longer to get done. So our investment in our brand and our products and our services and how we're differentiating ourselves from our competitors. I think our customers already see it. And they're going to see it a lot more in the coming quarters. It's going to be a little bit slower than we had hoped, but I know people are noticing it already. We can see the NPS scores on these converted aircraft are definitely the new aircraft and we're excited to get it done as quickly as we possibly can. Leslie Josephs — CNBC — Analyst Thank you. Operator The next question comes from Alison Sider. Your line is unmuted. Please go ahead. Alison Sider — The Wall Street Journal — Analyst Yeah, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about anything that United might be doing kind of in the wake of the handful of near collisions that the industry has been seeing. Are you — are there any particular steps that you're taking to respond to that? Or like do you have any theories about what's been going on? Scott Kirby — Chief Executive Officer So I'm proud of the whole aviation industry for the level of safety that we have, which is at least an order of magnitude higher than any others appropriately so. And when aviation professionals talk about safety is our number one priority that is something that's deeply embedded in the DNA and everyone, not just at United, but across the industry. United Airlines, in particular, is at the tip top of that pyramid in terms of safety. Our team, I think is doing a really good job of saying in today's environment, where you're coming back out of COVID, and there's new people working in airports or new air traffic controllers or whatever it is and increasing the amount of training, the time in training, quality of training. We're spending more money and a lot more time and resources there. And in fact, we put a Vice President, a guy named Mark Champion Phonetic , who's been a champion for safety for his entire career into a new role where he is exclusively responsible for safety and quality of training for our aviators. And I think we're leading on that and continuing to push to make the system what is already the safest system in the world even stronger, and I feel good about the — have there on and Mark being charged with that responsibility and having really as many resources as he need to the one person that doesn't have to live to his budget because he can do whatever he needs to do to make sure that we keep this the interest steep as we've always been. Alison Sider — The Wall Street Journal — Analyst So when you look in some of your own data, like do you see any kind of trend or any sort of connection between sort of the newness of people and incidents or potential incidents or anything like that? Scott Kirby — Chief Executive Officer Well, one of the great things about aviation is we use and we share data. We have great safety systems where our own employees can report without repercussion to them that encourages reporting because it's been, I guess, well over a decade since there has been accidents in the United States. What that means is we have to look for, say, that are close to the out of tolerance, throughout a tolerance to find it and sharing that data across the industry is a strength that I think is unique to aviation and what leads to our higher safety standards.

In addition, we have other members of the executive team on the line available to assist with Q amp;A. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Scott.J. Scott KirbyThanks, Kristina, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking the entire United team for delivering exceptional operation this quarter, given our hub geography. United almost all -- has the most flights impacted by weather, air traffic control delays of any U.S. airline. But despite this in Q1, we had the lowest mainline flight and seat cancellation rates of any airline in the country. That's important, not just for the obvious customer and brand impact, but it's also the key to hitting our planned capacity and CASM-ex target. I'm going to leave the detailed quarterly results and guidance to Gerry and Andrew. But today, I'll take a few minutes to talk about 4 emerging themes that have come to the foreground and I think are important to the United investment case. One, there appears to be a clear change in seasonality that is causing peak leisure demand months, March through October to be even stronger, while months that were historically reliant on business demand are weaker, that particularly impacts January, February and the first half of November and December. We believe demand is just structurally different than it was pre-pandemic, and we're still figuring out that new normal. Second, as we've expected all along, long-haul international is moving into the lead over domestic. Andrew will give more details, but this is a multiyear structural change based on aircraft retirements and pilot downgrades at essentially all long-haul U.S. airlines around the world, except United. But my third theme is an appropriately cautionary point. Our guidance and everything we're discussing today is our base case scenario based on what we're seeing right now. And what we're seeing right now is still strong demand. At airlines, the macroeconomic weakness is being offset with the countertrend of consumer spending continuing to rebalance back to services. And by the way, we still remain below our historical GDP relationship, arguably indicating more room to run on the revenue recovery. However, it seems clear that the macro risks are higher today than they were even a few months ago as demonstrated by the banking scare with Silicon Valley Bank. We saw an immediate drop in close-in business demand that lasted for about 2 weeks, but now appears to have recovered. Our base case, therefore, remains a mild recession or soft landing, which is consistent with what we're currently seeing in our bookings. But we agree that the tail risk is higher than normal. While we feel good about our 10 to 12 full year EPS, if the economy softens further, we've prepared for it by, a, having a lot of flexibility in the business on capacity of needed; b, improving our balance sheet to withstand the near-term issue with approximately 19 billion in liquidity and having reduced our total debt, including pension by 4.6 billion over the past 12 months; and c, it's actually my fourth theme, which is controlling what we can and hitting our CASM-ex target in this new, different and more challenging operating environment. We can't control what happens with the macro economy, but we can and are doing a great job of controlling our costs. You can't run your airline like it's 2019. It's different and harder now. Cancellation rates are the leading indicator of forward capacity and therefore, CASM-ex, and United is leading the way on this front. Gerry will discuss some of the year-over-year tailwinds that will drive lower CASM-ex in the back half of this year, but we only need CASM-ex to be approximately 1 point better in the second half of the year to hit our full year target. We remain solidly on track. To wrap up over the last 3 years, our industry is confronted a rapidly changing environment. United hasn't been perfect, but we've got a lot more right than wrong. And on the big picture, we've gotten it right and took the steps in the last 3 years to thrive in exactly this environment. International is stronger. The operating environment is more challenging, which means reliability is harder, but also at a premium for producing bottom line results and we have confidence that our gauge growth and execution are keeping United uniquely on track for our near- and long-term CASM-ex trajectory. That's not to say that there aren't real near-term risks because we all know there are. But we feel really good about the strategic setup and tactical execution here at United. I want to again thank the entire United team for their hard work this quarter. We have a busy summer season ahead forward to achieving even more operational and financial records. With that, I'll turn it over to Brett Brett J. HartThank you, Scott, and thank you to our United team for their hard work this quarter. As Scott mentioned, we continue to see the benefits of running a strong operation. In the first quarter, United led the industry with the lowest seat cancellation rate despite around 20% of our flights being impacted by weather, the most of any of our competitors. This was the first time since 2012 that we led on this metric. Additionally, United was first or second in the quarter for on-time departures at nearly all of our hub locations, including those heavily impacted by winter weather like O'Hare and Denver. Our airline is built to run well and recover fast, and we expect our operation to reflect that through the peak summer season. We continue to navigate the challenges in the current operating environment. Specifically, a constrained industry infrastructure. United is working with the U.S. Department of Transportation and FAA regarding operational disruptions and air traffic staffing challenges. The FAA's decision to consider commercial air traffic with managing the growing number of space launches, combined with the FAA's recent move to give carriers more flexibility and how we all fly in and out of New York area airports shows that the FAA is listening to feedback and finding ways we can all work together. In March, we took steps to reduce our schedule in the New York region and DCA by around 30 daily departures over the summer period to provide the airspace relief requested by the FAA. The schedule reductions are largely regional jet focused and will be redeployed at our other hubs, minimizing the capacity impact to the system. It is our hope that this will drive improved customer experience, offline United in the New York area and throughout our network. We're excited to announce that we reached a tentative agreement with our nearly 30,000 employees represented by the International Association of Machinists, with voting on the agreement expected to be completed by May 1. We are very proud of the work that our team does daily to support our operation and create a positive travel experience for our customers. Regarding other labor agreements, a new contract with our technicians represented by the IBT who gratified in January, and we are still in active negotiations with our flight attendants represented by the AFA and our pilots represented by ALPA. As a reminder, we reached an agreement with our dispatchers represented by PAFCA last year. We look forward to sharing further updates in the future. I once again want to thank our team for being the best in the industry. We remain confident in our outlook as we leverage our industry-leading operational performance and network advantages. And with that, I'll hand it over to Andrew to discuss the revenue environment Andrew P. NocellaThanks, Brett. First quarter top line revenues of 11.4 billion finished consistent with our updated guidance of up 51% versus 2022. TRASM was up 22.5% year-over-year. While we were below our initial guidance, we expect that our TRASM performance in the first quarter will be top tier. As expected, other revenues in the quarter, while strong, are growing at a slower rate than passenger revenues, the opposite trend we saw last year and over the course of the pandemic. While Cargo revenue declined 37% year-over-year, it remains 39% above the same period in 2019. MileagePlus other revenue had yet another strong quarter and was up 25% year-over-year, driven by our strategic partnership with Chase. United Credit Card continued to set records in Q1, including the highest first quarter ever for card spend , new accounts up over 30% year-over-year and account attrition near historic lows. We also welcome Richard Nunn to the United team as the new CEO of MileagePlus. As Scott indicated, we believe we're seeing different revenue seasonality for the United Network post-pandemic, and that change to impact our relative margin in Q1. New seasonality positively impacted March through October 2022, where new remote work schedule simulated business, particularly premium leisure. Ultimately, if these trends continue, we expect to be able to operate a more consistent level of capacity between March and October and future years. However, we believe the new seasonality negatively impacted Q1 in January or February, along with the first halves in November and December. With United's relatively small presence in the Caribbean and Florida where demand is usually strong in Q1 and over the winter months, the United network is more reliant on business traffic that has not fully recovered to pre-pandemic volumes in these periods. United's global network and East West strengths are simply better aligned to March through October, post pandemic where leisure and premium leisure business compensate for less traditional business traffic. As we head into Q2 2023, we are tracking ahead of 2022 and all the ways that we measure business traffic, a really good sign for revenue momentum. While it's still early on, we do see corporate business from May and June tracking well ahead of the previous Months at this time. The business traffic rebound we're seeing is strongest in global long-haul markets, where a video conference is not a substitute for an in-person meeting. The recent bank and scare did initiate a slowdown in demand across multiple customer types in the quarter. Impact on business demand for domestic flying was the most significant, impact on domestic leisure was smaller, an impact on overall international demand was actually minimal. In the weeks after the scare, we saw business demand relative to the same period of 2019 declined by 8 points after steady progress experienced to the quarter to that point. This trend has since reversed back to pre-bank and scare levels. In Q2, we expect total revenue to be up 14% to 16% versus the second quarter of 2022, with capacity up approximately 18.5%. Our expectation to our revenue in the second quarter continued to show strength with approximately 8% to 10% growth in domestic revenues and almost 30% for International. Second quarter bookings and revenues do look good versus the same point in 2022, with booked yields up 13% and 31% above 2019, respectively. For 2023, we expect to expand international flying by approximately twice the rate of domestic leaning into the favorable supply-demand balance that we expect. We'll be focused on extending United's leading position across the Atlantic and the Asia and the South Pacific. We believe this capacity deployment plan will set us up to meet our financial objectives given the stronger revenue outlook we are seeing for international flying and the rebound in Polaris cabin. We'll also pass 2 critical milestones by this summer with all United international wide-body jets having the latest generation Polaris seat and a premium plus cabin. While further return to corporate business will help profitability in all quarters, we're not assuming that will occur in our 2023 revenue outlook. United scheduled capacity this summer is up 39% in the Atlantic but industry capacity, excluding United, is estimated to be down about 1%. United will operate an average of 207 daily flights across the Atlantic this summer. Across the Pacific, United plans to be up 14%, excluding China, with industry capacity down about 7%, both versus 2019. Overall, international ASMs will be 46% of United's capacity this summer versus 43% in 2019. Yesterday, we announced another set of capacity increases to the South Pacific ideally timed for the Southern summer later this year. These include the first-ever non-stop service from San Francisco to Christchurch, a new service from Los Angeles to Auckland in partnership with Air New Zealand, and to Los Angeles to Brisbane, where we'll connect to our new partner, Virgin Australia. Rebuilding connectivity back to our original 2019 standards in our Mid-Con hubs and Dallas will also be a long-term focus for our domestic line. The loss of regional jets turn the pandemic without mainline jets to backfill them cause connectivity to suffer. Peak bank sizes at our high flow hubs are down 10% to 20% versus 2019. We were able to build connectivity and margins in 2018 and 2019 when we increase bank size connectivity, and we expect to execute a similar strategy in 2023 and 2024. However, this time around, we'll do it with the appropriately sized 737 jets instead of single-class regional jets. As requested by the FAA, we've reduced our planned flights from New York City this summer, including to and from Newark. We believe this will be the first time in years that Newark will operate within the airport's capacity abilities in most hours and consistent with the slot allocations. We're optimistic that between the new terminals and capacity consistent with the runway's capabilities, the customer experience will improve dramatically, and we appreciate the partnership with the FAA to make this happen. United will gain up to 17 new mainline gates in Terminal A and Newark this summer versus 2022, which will improve Newark's reliability and customer experience. Along with the new Newark gates, we will open a new United Club in Terminal A and in Terminal C later this year, adding 38,000 square feet and will be up 161% in club space relative to 2019. As impressive as that club space measurement is in Newark, our club members in Denver will experience an opening of 3 United Clubs over the next year that include a total of 97,000 square feet, a 149% increase versus 2019. Construction of our new gates in Denver is also almost complete and will have 90 gates up from 66, we had in 2019, which we expect will allow us to dramatically increase bank sizes and connectivity in 2024 and 2025. At United, we remain focused on our high ground, structural strengths focused on global long haul, correcting connectivity issues in our Mid-Con hubs that surface during the pandemic and, of course, gauge, increases that are consistent with our large hub markets. Our capacity plan for this year remains in place without adjustment as we operate with strong operational results. With that, I wanted to say thanks to the entire United team, and I'll turn it over to Gerry Gerald LadermanThanks, Andrew, and good morning to everyone. Let's start with our first quarter results. Our pre-tax loss of 256 million was in line with expectations and at the better end of our updated guidance issued last month. We saw losses in January and February due to seasonal weakness, but March turned solidly profitable. Our first quarter fuel price of 3.33 came in at the lower end of our revised guidance range. This was still about 0.14 higher than our expectation at the start of the quarter due to a spike in jet fuel prices in late January and early February. Turning to nonfuel costs. Our first quarter CASM-ex came in slightly better than our revised guidance range at down 0.1% versus the first quarter last year. Our operational performance in the first quarter was truly exceptional, and our CASM-ex fee is largely due to the cost benefit of a reliable operation. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately 19 billion in liquidity. We continue to leverage the flexibility provided by our cash with financing opportunities and paying down debt. We generated over 3 billion in operating cash flow in the first quarter, the highest for any quarter in United's history, and we produced free cash flow of over 1 billion. Over the last 12 months, our total debt, including pension liability, has declined by approximately 4.6 billion, and we remain on track to meet our 2023 target of adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDAR of less than 3x. Looking ahead, we expect second quarter CASM-ex to be flat to up 2%, with capacity up approximately 18.5% both versus the second quarter of last year. Strong cost performance underpins our confidence in the earnings trajectory of the business in the second quarter, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of 3.50 to 4, with a fuel price of 2.80 to 3. As noted in our investor update, this fuel price is based on prices as of April 12. As others mentioned, our strong operational performance in the first quarter sets the tone for the remainder of the year, and is key to our conviction in achieving our CASM-ex targets. For the full year, we continue to be on track to keep CASM-ex approximately flat versus 2022 with nonfuel unit costs in the second half of this year declining versus the second half of last year. To give context as to why we expect CASM-ex in the second half of this year to improve on a year-over-year basis versus the first half of this year, it's helpful to consider the 2022 cost baseline. With COVID still significantly impacting the business in the first half of last year, we have certain unique headwinds in the first half of this year when comparing costs on a year-over-year basis. There are 2 notable examples. Revenue in the first half of 2022 was much lower than the second half of 2022, which meant that distribution costs were also much lower in the first half of last year versus the second half. This drives the year-over-year comparisons for the first half of this year to be commensurately higher than the second half of this year. A similar phenomenon exists with maintenance expense. As Omicron abated and the recovery took hold, we ramped up our maintenance activity in the back half of '22 to more normalized levels. Again, the difference in year-over-year costs are much more muted in the second half of this year versus the first half. So simply put, the 2 items represent a 1- to 2-point CASM-ex headwind in the first half of this year, which won't exist in the second half. These drivers, along with strategic cost management, gauge growth and running a reliable operation support our expectation that we will hit our flat CASM-ex target for the year. When combined with our revenue outlook, we remain confident in our trajectory towards 10 to 12 in adjusted diluted EPS for the full year, whether we face a mild recession or soft landing. As we have left the starting gate for our United Next plan, I'm encouraged by the progress we've made not only financially but in our operation and across the entire organization. While we continue to live in uncertain times. I know that we will successfully manage everything under our control as we continue on a path to reach our full year financial objectives. And with that, I will turn it over to Kristina for the Q amp;A Kristina MunozThank you, Gerry. We will now take questions from the analyst community. (Operator Instructions) Cylus, please describe the procedure to ask a question Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs Catherine Maureen O'BrienSo there's been a lot of investor concern recently around the domestic slowdown. So I think I'll just get right to that. I know United is built to lean into the international strength. But can you just help us think about what's driving the domestic unit revenue performance to underperform international, at least based on first quarter versus '19. Is there a shift in leisure demand to international from domestic that might be exaggerated right now post pandemic? International business is stronger, as you know prepared remarks, something else? And then I saw you had another record first quarter build in the air traffic liability. Would also be helpful just to talk through how much you have on the books, domestic versus international first quarter Andrew P. NocellaSure, Catherine. We're getting this question about domestic strength a lot and we should really address it. The way when we go back thinking about it, how to describe the conditions of this Q2, we have to recall Q2 of last year, Q2 of 2022 was the best domestic TRASM quarter ever for United with TRASM up 25% versus Q2 of 2019, which, by the way, was a prior record holder. We simply sent a really hard comp for Q2 2023. And also last year at this time, international markets were not widely open to travelers, in my view, selected domestic trips out of caution, just creating unprecedented demand relative to the number of seats available to sell. This year's conditions are different. International travel is more or less completely open, and we see customers clearly excited about taking a long-haul trip. Domestic capacity is also now comparable to 2019 levels. So here are the facts, domestic ASMs at United will be up about 10% in Q2 2023 year-over-year. And our TRASM outlook for domestic will be negative low single digits from what I've said today. Total domestic revenue should finish well above 2022, given our TRASM outlook on capacity growth of about 10%. We're currently booked about 10% ahead in gross revenue at this point compared to last year, and we're about 54% into the booking curve for the quarter. I just don't see these facts as weak when revenue is on target to again break the record and TRASM is likely to be just a bit behind an amazingly strong 2022. In summary, when Q2 2023 is in the books, we will likely be our second (inaudible) best domestic TRASM quarter ever with record total domestic revenues. The only thing negative, I think I can say is that as good as domestic looks, it's just not matching global long-haul revenue outlook, which is very strong and where United has focused a majority of its capacity Catherine Maureen O'BrienNon ATL Andrew P. NocellaOn the ATL, I think it's seasonally moving in a normal way. I don't know, Gerry wants to add anything else on the ATL question Gerald LadermanOkay. Your question about international versus domestic, you're actually the first person to ask us that question. So we'll follow-up with you OperatorThe next question comes from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan Jamie Nathaniel BakerJust chuckling at Gerry's response to Catie there. On the ATL, Gerry, the build obviously helped with free cash flow generation in the quarter. Presumably, the ATL will incrementally moderate in the second half as it often does. Do you still think you can cover this year's 9 billion in CapEx and generate positive free cash flow Gerald LadermanYes, Jamie, I think we can Jamie Nathaniel BakerOkay. Fair enough. Second to Andrew, relative to the international component. You've got a lot of new route activity. Can you speak to sort of like same-store sales or same-store RASM or revenue, I guess, relative to those new routes? And how does the ramp to profitability in all of these new markets compared to that in the past? I mean, are new markets maturing much faster? Or does it take about the same amount of time as it ever take? I'm just trying to think about the read-through as some of these trends normalize next year Andrew P. NocellaThere's -- for global long haul, there is virtually no school up right now, Jamie. It gives the supply-demand equation is just not what it's ever been in the past. While United supply across the Atlantic and Pacific is dramatically up, and we're happy it is dramatically up, obviously. Industry flies down. So what I would tell you is that the new routes come in very quickly with very strong profitability, which is why we keep adding them. That being said, in terms of same-store sales, I will say that London Heathrow is probably our weakest at this point because there's just -- that there is a large amount of capacity in London Heathrow relative to the rest of the world, and we've grown there. And our connections within Europe in our key hubs are -- have not fully recovered, just like they haven't domestically. And so we actually do see some relative weakness in certain parts of the global network off of a strong base. But the new routes to your question are just coming in with home runs on day 1.OperatorThe next question comes from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research Conor T. CunninghamJust the 2023 cost-ex rate seems pretty encouraging. I know you mentioned maintenance and distribution as being a main driver from the first half to second half, but it still seems mean that you're holding incremental cost. I mean, that may be the cost of doing business right now. But just curious if you could talk about what potentially rolls off next year as we start to think about CASM-ex there Gerald LadermanSo I'm not sure I would call it rolling off. But keep in mind, next year, one of the benefits we're really going to start seeing is that growth in Mainline gauge, as the aircraft continue to come in. That process is really just starting this year. So next year, we get the full run rate of the larger gauge aircraft and take even more next year. So when you're looking sort of where the tailwinds are next year gauges one. And the comps year-over-year are going to be better. Think of this year is really finally getting to the run rate of the post-COVID sort of full operation. So I think as an industry, we're done with a lot of the surprises we all kind of saw coming out of COVID with some of the cost pressures. So I think from the cost side, the business has become more stable and a little more predictable Conor T. CunninghamOkay. Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the evolving booking curve and seasonality that you've been talking about. Just curious how your compact going to combat those challenges going forward? I mean Delta has mentioned they're talking about looking at like overbooking and like incurring with the inventory. Just curious what the strategy is at United, if there is one to combat those changes in the booking curve Andrew P. NocellaSure. Well, we think we clearly have the best RM system in the world, by the way. That's what it'll start off with. While there's been a small change in the number of tickets not flown in the quarter, due to the increased flexibility created on United eliminated change fees. It's our view that it's not really material and it's fully accounted for by our RM systems. And I'll add on to that, our no-show rate is lower as well, and we will not be changing our overbooking levels at this point OperatorThe next question comes from Savi Syth from Raymond James Savanthi Nipunika Prelis-SythJust a question on the MAX deliveries. It looks like you had 3 more deliveries than the prior plan in 1Q, but for the full year, kind of slipped a little bit. Just curious how you're feeling about confidence on kind of the MAX deliveries, especially given the recent news Gerald LadermanOkay. Savi, from what we know on the recent news, we don't think that's going to have much of an impact on us, certainly won't have an impact on second quarter and what -- and I think you may have seen this yourself, is Boeing has gotten back on track on delivering aircraft. Deal the issues that they had over the prior few years, they've really managed well. And the impact from what we know today for the full year just will be minor Savanthi Nipunika Prelis-SythOkay. That's helpful, Gerry. And maybe along those lines, a follow-up on the fuel efficiency, there's a little kind of surprised by kind of what we saw here in the first quarter, maybe a little bit less than what we've seen last year. What's your expectation around how that trends kind of going forward, especially kind of given that, that's another part of the kind of the cost benefit in the United Next Plan Gerald LadermanWell, as we start seeing more and more of the MAXs, we'll start seeing that improvement that we've sort of talked about on United Next. Remember, we've just started taking delivery of those incremental aircraft. And there'll be a nice pop in that as well once the MAX 10 delivers at some point Savanthi Nipunika Prelis-SythSo just from a critical mass standpoint, when does that -- when do you think roughly that is based on like what you know today, I guess Gerald LadermanYes. It starts to kick in next year, critical mass, maybe the year after Savanthi Nipunika Prelis-SythOkay. That's really helpful, Thank you Gerald LadermanI'm just going to see the trend. Quarter-by-quarter OperatorThe next question comes from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank Michael John LinenbergWhen I look at your sort of loads from fourth quarter to March quarter, I mean, you can see that seasonal hit. And Andrew, when I saw that I sort of thought maybe it had to do with a higher no-show rate, but you sort of just addressed that, that is not an issue. As you add more service to places like New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Brazil, et cetera, does that -- we should see improvement in that, right? Maybe you never actually are able to get to the level of, say, an American or Delta from a seasonal perspective. But to some extent, you should be able to mitigate that as we think about the seasonality. Is that -- is that kind of where we're headed? Do we see that really start to narrow versus the industry Andrew P. NocellaIt's a good question. And our intent is to get it to narrow. But we do -- we're simply smaller in Florida due to a lot of reasons that can't be addressed in a matter of a few quarters, we have to be addressed over years. And so while our goal is to narrow that gap in Q1, I don't think to be blunt, we're going to be able to eliminate it. Clearly, the introduction of counter-seasonal fly into the South Pacific definitely helps put it in the right direction, and we'll be looking for more opportunities and we'll be looking to grow Florida, I think, faster than probably most of our competitors because we're just so relatively small. But ultimately, I do think Q1 is going to continue to be our weakest quarter and a recovery of business traffic in Q1 will do the most to help our relative Q1 results Michael John LinenbergOkay. And then just sort of as a follow-on and tied to that, when you look at the announcement that you did make yesterday, I mean it's -- it seems like it's going to need a decent amount of additional capacity. And when I look at your fleet this year, I think you took 2, 78 in the March quarter, it does not look like we're going to see any more widebodies coming in. How are you funding a lot of that new service later this year? Should we assume that maybe it's going to -- China is not going to come back as much? Are you going to pull from other parts of the operation? I'm just trying to figure out where you're going to get the aircraft because some of these routes require more than one airplane just to do daily round trip service Andrew P. NocellaDefinitely was quite a few aircraft heading towards the South Pacific. What I would tell you is that we just seasonally reduced Europe and we would otherwise, but many of those widebodies into our domestic system. And this year, our maintenance. And this year, those aircraft will be flying to the South Pacific, which we think is their best use. In regards to China, we continue to be stuck at 4 flights per week. We are preparing to supply more than that, but have been unable to get that done so far. But hopefully, later this year, we will be flying more to China, and we have the aircraft to do so if the conditions are -- allow us to do so OperatorThe next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI Duane Thomas PfennigwerthI wanted to ask about one of the themes Scott started the call with on flexibility. And maybe a follow-up to Mike's question just there. But first on seasonal shaping capacity. Given the new normal, is there a greater emphasis recently on seasonally shaping capacity? And how does maybe lack of regional lift or lack of ability to kind of flex up on regionals limit your ability to do that, if at all Andrew P. NocellaIt's a really good question. And I am hopeful that after further evidence that we'll be able to operate a more stable schedule all the way from March through the end of October, which I think will definitely benefit our cost structure having less of the peak. However, we are not there just yet. I think we need to make it through this year. We need to see how the remote work schedules continue to play out. We need to, in particular, see how this September and this October do -- they were fantastic, obviously, last year. And I think that will help us validate for next year whether we actually change the seasonal shape in, as I just described. And hopefully, we can, but we're not ready to really jump into the deep end of that pool today. So we will continue to peak the airline in July as we normally do, and we'll see where we go from there. In terms of regional jets, the lack of regional jets has definitely hurt our connectivity. This is an issue. I talked about it, and we're very focused on rebuilding that connectivity with the right jets going forward. And in fact, we don't intend to ever go back to the fleet of approximately 600 regional jets we had in 2019. We think the economics have changed. We think the business has changed and we need to change with it. That being said, on the good news front, the regional jet pilot situation has recently -- in our mind, stabilized. We're no longer losing pilots at the same rate we were earlier -- very early this year or last year. And the production of block hours in our regional jet division at the end of this year will be consistent with the production of block hours that we started the year with. And I can tell you that our original budget for that was not that. We thought we would continue to see deterioration. So the good news there is the regional jets are going to be able to at least temporarily help us boost our connectivity as we wait for all of our mainline jet (inaudible) Boeing to deliver over the next 2 or so years Duane Thomas PfennigwerthAnd then just sticking with the flexibility theme on capacity and the idea that you could kind of take capacity lower if the environment warranted. How much lower could you take it, I guess, relative to the high teens, 20% in the back half? And just conceptually, are we solving for margins this year? Or are we solving for CASM Andrew P. NocellaI don't think we're ever solving for CASM. We're solving for margin and, of course, the 10% to 12% So that will always be our focus. And we're going to maintain the flexibility. Like I said, I'm pretty bullish about the international environment, and that's going to generate the large lion's share of our ASM growth this year. And I expect International to be strong all the way through the end of October. And so far, it shoes that. It's still early, obviously, when we look at that far, but we're very optimistic. And domestically, Gerry set us up at a really good fleet plan where we have a significant number of older A320 and A319 aircraft that we could easily fly less or we could put on the ground if we thought that was necessary as we solve to reach the right margin and right EPS targets that we have for the year OperatorThe next question comes from Helane Becker from Cowen Helane Renee BeckerTwo questions. One, did you say what pension contribution would be this year? And if not, could you? And then the other question I had was just on United Next and where you are in '23 versus the plan? And what progress is on maybe some of the bigger items. I think you just addressed Andrew, the regional jet and the narrow-body shift in mix, but maybe connecting smaller cities or connecting bank changes or something like that Gerald LadermanHelane, yes, we did not say anything about pension. Nothing's changed from our recent disclosures. There is -- we expect no pension contributions this year. Our pensions are in good shape and both with the pension calculations that can be made and interest rates having nicely reduced the liabilities. We wouldn't expect any pension contributions actually for a couple of years Helane Renee BeckerThat's great to know Andrew P. NocellaOn the United Next comment, as I've indicated a bit earlier, my 1 focus domestically is this connectivity issue. We can clearly see it when we look at our RASM by flight by market that we are just -- we're missing a lot of connectivity relative to where we were. And so as we go forward, we're going to be very focused on rebuilding that connectivity and getting the bank sizes back to where they were, hopefully, in 2019, but it is going to take some time. But we're optimistic just like we did it in 2017 and 2018 that we're going to do it again, and it's going to be very accretive to margin profitability and, of course, to RASM as we build back the connectivity. So it is a really important focus of our domestic flying, and we're ready to get that implemented as soon as possible OperatorThe next question comes from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley Ravi ShankerI think despite the kind of tough macro outlook, pretty clear what you guys are expecting that things are fine for now, but there's high probability of a tail risk event. Can you help us with kind of what data points you're looking at to determine if these tail risks are either receding or materializing? Are these kind of airline specific data points or these broader macro data points into the latter kind of -- where are some of those data points you're tracking Andrew P. NocellaWell, maybe I'll start and talk about it from a business traffic recovery and what we're seeing in there because I do think one of the most common questions I get is business traffic recovering and what is it going to look like. And first of all, I wonder whether the old methods of measuring business travel will be the same in the future. But for now, it's all we really have to really benchmark against 2019. I will say that as we look at business traffic 3 different ways. The first is from larger corporations that have a contract with United. The second from a set of demands from agencies that specialize in business traffic, and the third is based on ticket attributes. The third is clearly the most encompassing view as it includes small and medium-sized businesses that don't have an agency or don't have a contract for United. So in Q4, the revenue recovery rate was between 70% and 85% for these 3 categories. In Q1, the revenue recovery rate for these 3 measurements range from 85% to 97%. And for the first 2 weeks of April, the recovery ranged from 95% to 101%. I think this data in the last 2 weeks of April was a surprise to us as we've seen more conservative measurements, start to approach 100%. The fact that large corporations are getting close to 100%, is a nice tailwind to United. As many of you know, this is critically important -- critically important component to our revenues. I'll also say that the recovery in global long-haul business is a few points of head of domestic. And all these measurements are just a good sign that our planned international revenue increases, our capacity increases are moving in the right direction. We obviously need more time to see if this trend will hold. But what I can tell you in the last week or so after reviewing this data become a lot more positive even as many of the headlines continue to predict a recession. As I said in my opening statement, the trends for May look ahead of March. I can also confirm in absolute dollars the last 14 days have been the best booking days for business traffic revenue that we've seen since the pandemic. I'll also add, since this step-up in business demand is very recent, we've not incorporated it into our revenue outlook for the quarter Ravi ShankerThat's incredibly helpful. And since my follow-up question was going to be about SMB versus enterprise corporate. I'll switch it up and ask you about the cargo business. Obviously, a small portion of the business would probably very volatile given that there was one of the bigger kind of pandemic era winners. How are you seeing that evolve through '23 and '24? And what's the normalized level there Andrew P. NocellaYes. So I mean cargo stepped down in Q1 and stepped down exactly with our plan, still well ahead of 2019, which is nice to see. But we are seeing very low prices, low yields across the system, particularly outside of United. We've been -- I think we've done a great job with holding yields where they're at through our -- really the best cargo team in the world, in my opinion. But not only is air freight challenges now, but also sea freight where rates are incredibly low. So we're holding our own. I think again, we're executing consistent with our plan, and we've got this baked in for the rest of the year. We do expect to see more and more pressure on cargo yields going forward. But in the United team is executing in an amazing way. Our relative size to our primary competitors, you can see it in the numbers. And so I'm still actually bullish about the business relative to 2019. But look, it's last Q1 in particular, we reached an unbelievable high based on where we were with the pandemic and COVID we didn't expect we would be able to reachieve that number, and we didn't. But again, we're on plan OperatorThe next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies Sheila Karin KahyaogluScott, I wanted to ask you maybe a cost question. You've been fairly outspoken about airlines needing more employees for the same level of operations. And your ASMs per employee are now just 3% below 2019 versus 6% to 7% in the second half of '22. And presumably, there's some advanced hiring as you're preparing for new aircraft. Is there room to further close the gap versus 2019 on this basis as we think about ASM mix and new aircraft deliveries?J. Scott KirbyWell, I guess we'll see. But I feel really good about what we've done with running with higher resources than we did pre-pandemic, it's leading to the best operation that any one of the countries run the best operation, frankly, that we've ever run. That's great for our customers. That's great for our brand. I also think it's turning out at least right now in this environment to be the lowest CASM outcome that by being able to run a reliable operation, the most expensive thing to do is cancel the flight and being able to run a reliable operation is what is giving us the best CASM results in the industry and given us confidence about CASM results going forward. So I think we're at the right place at the moment. It's obviously very -- if the operating environment gets easier down the road, it's obviously easy to adjust that, especially as we're growing just slow down the hiring for a month or 2 and you're right back to where you were. So easy to adjust but I feel -- I'm really proud of how the team has done operationally. And I think it has been the lowest CASM outcome we could have had by running reliable operations Sheila Karin KahyaogluAnd if I could just ask a question about your premium performance, which was pretty good. Premium relative to 2019, up 25% compared to total domestic up 5%. Can you break that out in any sort of way, whether it's RASM or yield performance? How we should think about the continued growth there Andrew P. NocellaSure. I mean, I've been really happy actually with our progress on the premium side in all of our cabins, particularly for Polaris. We've been just making a ton of progress in the Polaris Cabin given the rebound in business traffic, but we still have more to come. In March, for example, our load factor was up 10 points year-over-year and 5 points versus 2019. We sold a lot of seats, but we sold business travel seats accounted for 7 points down year-over-year. And premium leisure comp traffic compensated for that by being up 7 points. So it just to offset it, but that came at a lower yield. So we're carefully also trying to keep increased premium leisure demand and revenue created since the pandemic while accommodating more and more of traditional business traffic. There are lots of puts and takes with this given our load factors, but we do think that there's potential to get this done, particularly as we continue to integrate the new 737s, which come into our fleet with a large amount of premium seating most of our growth is tilted towards premium seating at this point, particularly as we retire the single class regional jets from the network. And so I will say that I think we're just hitting on all cylinders on this front and the progress we're seeing in Polaris in particular, with higher load factors, backfilling temporarily lease or premium leisure. And ultimately, as long-haul business traffic, as I said earlier, it's coming back, faster, we were optimistic that we're going to get Polaris completely back to where it was in terms of relative profitability margin later this year OperatorThe next question comes from Scott Group from Wolfe Research Scott H. GroupSo when I look at domestic capacity for the second quarter, it's back below 2019 levels. It's only up marginally from Q1, which is a lot less than normal. I guess, is this that -- when you go back to the plan from the beginning of the year, is this a change in how you're thinking about domestic capacity? Is this a sort of a one-off quarter? Or is this more of a multi-quarter, more prolonged view of domestic capacity Andrew P. NocellaI do think it is a little bit lower than Q1. I think you're absolutely correct on that. It's where the numbers shook out. We clearly leaned as hard as quickly as we could into global long haul, which really turns on in March and April, and that's what shook out for domestic because we thought that was the best place to put the capacity but you should see a little bit more domestic ASM growth in the second half than what we're seeing in the second quarter Scott H. GroupOkay. And then I know it's early. You talked about next year, another focus on Mainline Gauge. Any early preliminary thoughts on how you're thinking about overall capacity growth in '24 Andrew P. NocellaI don't think we're prepared to give our guidance for '24. We're excited to continue implementing United Next. And most importantly, for domestic, we were excited to make sure that we rebuild the connectivity as quickly as we can back to where we were pre-pandemic. And I think that's our biggest driver of domestic RASM next year. And that's really all I can say at this point OperatorThe next question comes from David Vernon from Bernstein David Scott VernonTwo questions for you guys on the new seasonality. Andrew, can you maybe talk a little bit more about some of the short-term challenges and opportunities you're dealing with from a revenue management perspective, things like overbooking and how you're sort of managing yields with this sort of shift in customer behavior, which seems relatively new? And then, Scott, I'd love to get your long-term perspective on what do you think United might need to do a little bit differently if we're going to be relying more on the leisure market, things like do you still get the same bang for the buck out of like a Polaris Lounge, for example, if this shift continues longer term Andrew P. NocellaSure. What I would say is the booking curves have adjusted. They're both international and domestic are booking further out. International more extreme than domestic. And so we are -- our RM systems have adjusted for this very, very quickly, and we're booked ahead in our global long-haul system based on the change in the booking curve. Domestic has also moved out. There's, I think, 4 points greater outside of 21 days and there is inside of 21 days right now. And again, RM systems have adjusted for that. That being said, we are managing to keep yield domestically as close as possible to where we were last year. And as we look at this, we expect we're going to run lower load factors in our domestic entity in Q2 as a result. That's part of our plan. We think it's the right strategy. And we do think we'll be able to fill up some of these seats were closer in higher yield in business. And the fact that business has had significant recent recovery in the last 2 weeks makes me even more bullish that we've executed the right strategy there and that we do have capacity available to accommodate closer in business demand to the extent it materializes in Q2.J. Scott KirbyAnd on the longer term, it's an interesting question. First, I mean I wouldn't conclude that business -- we'll see what happens with business demand. In the near term, though, the most obvious things we can do are the things that are happening in revenue management. Andrew talked about, we have the best revenue management system and team in the industry. That is true. We made huge investments coming into the pandemic included it during the pandemic. And the team it's just really like none of these things, they're generally not that surprising. We didn't really appreciate fully the seasonality shift, but the revenue management system is working well. And that's one of the obvious places Andrew talked also about pivoting the network. It's another one that straightforward things to do, fly more to Florida, fly more leisure destinations. In terms of things like Polaris Class, Andrew also talked about the fact that while we have less business traffic flying internationally, we have a lot more premium leisure. So I wouldn't anticipate, at least in the near term, any radical shifts in the strategy and mostly probably come in terms of capacity deployment, more than anything which one could be to have a fungible assets. Is that relatively easy for us to do OperatorWe will now switch to the media portion of the call. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Claire Buchi Unidentified ParticipantI wanted to ask about summer operations. You mentioned cutting flights in New York earlier in the call. I wanted to ask about what other operational changes United is making this summer to avoid a repeat of the disruptions of last summer Torbjorn J. EnqvistClaire, this is Toby. Well, we've done a lot. Let's talk about Newark and New York first. So we work with FAA. FAA gave us a waiver for the summer. So we are down about 30 flights per day in Newark and at a peak times that's going to make a big difference. Also, like Andrew said, we are not the only one. So for the first time in a long while in New York, we actually will be scheduled to on a blue sky day, at least what the capacity of the airport can actually hold. So we're really bullish on that. And on top of that, and Andrew mentioned this in his remarks as well, we're actually going to have 17 new normal mainline gates in the brand-new Terminal A in Newark. And if you guys haven't been there, it's a fantastic terminal. I mean it's a world-class terminal replacing a 1969 (inaudible) terminal that we were in last year. So just right off the bat right there, that's going to be a huge improvement. The other thing -- again, United actually did, if you guys remember, we actually did pretty well last year, last summer. I think the biggest issues we had was actually the infrastructure, especially in the trans-Atlantic. And now actually, we're just in Europe 2 weeks ago and talked to our biggest Air Force, the Heathrow, Frankfurt and Munich. And they are 1 year ahead of all the hiring and all the other things there. So again, it's summer, it's peaked up. It's not going to be perfect, but we are in a much, much, much better place than we were last year and we released a job I mean all the terminals in Europe is actually open this year. We had large turf terminals in Europe last year, both in Amsterdam and Heathrow and others that (inaudible) even open, and they are wide open and open for business this year. So we're -- again, we're -- we call it summer readiness. We are not taking it lightly. Summer is our Super Bowl, is the toughest time to operate. It's going to have some tough pace surely with weather and things, but we're going to be in a much, much better place than we were last year Unidentified ParticipantI just -- Delta said that they were flying less than they had expected. They were trying to reduce the turnaround time for maintenance on aircraft. Is there just any of that detail that you can share with us?J. Scott KirbyWell, I would just -- I'll take that, too. We've already done that. So when we talk about we're not building our own like it's 2019, we built those buffers in prospectively and in advance. And that's why we ran the best operation in the country because we were ahead of the curve. And perhaps others are catching up to that, but we were ahead of that curve, and that's what led to the best operation in the country in the first quarter OperatorOur next question comes from Leslie Josephs Leslie JosephsJust curious on the retrofits, how many of those do you expect to get this year and how many were you expecting before? And what was the outlook for 2024? And then it's been almost 7 years since you've launched Polaris. And just curious if you are and how are you thinking about kind of the successor to that Andrew P. NocellaOkay. That's a good question, and I will not answer the latter question other than the teams are always working on innovations at United across all of our business functions. And I'm sure somebody somewhere is working on something great when it comes to seats and we'll leave it at that. In regards to retrofits, and I don't have the numbers here. We'll have somebody call you back. But the reality is the supply challenges across the board whether it be IFE systems, chips, seats and many other things are just more challenging than they've ever been in our business. And while we converted our first A319 in a few weeks, it should be flying hopefully, any day now in the new interior, and we have multiple lines that we'll be doing this summer. So you'll see a rapid increase in the number of aircraft with the signature interior through retrofits and through new aircraft. The total time to convert all the aircraft is just going to be longer than we expected, unfortunately. Probably by a year or 2, to be frank. So we will get there. It will just take a little bit longer than we had originally intended. But you'll see material progress. We'll get some of the numbers out to you separately. By the end of this year Leslie JosephsAnd do you expect that to hurt your revenue premium at all for people that are booking up or choosing United because it has those features Andrew P. NocellaNo, what I would tell you is that the increase amount of getting on an aircraft, the United Signature Interior is going to go up rapidly. It's just the tail of this is going to take a little longer to get done. So our investment in our brand and our products and our services and how we're differentiating ourselves from our competitors. I think our customers already see it. And they're going to see it a lot more in the coming quarters. It's going to be a little bit slower than we had hoped, but I know people are noticing it already. We can see the NPS scores on these converted aircraft are definitely the new aircraft and we're excited to get it done as quickly as we possibly can OperatorThe next question comes from Alison Sider Alison SiderYes, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about anything that United might be doing kind of in the wake of the handful of mirror collisions that the industry has been seeing. Are there any particular steps that you're taking to respond to that? Or like do you have any theories about what's been going on?J. Scott KirbySo I'm proud of the whole aviation industry for the level of safety that we have, which is at least an order of magnitude higher than any others appropriately so. And when aviation professionals talk about safety is our 1 priority that is something that's deeply embedded in the DNA and everyone, not just at United, but across the industry. United Airlines, in particular, is at the tip top of that pyramid in terms of safety. Our team, I think, is doing a really good job of saying in today's environment, where you're coming back out of COVID, and there's new people working in airports or new air traffic controllers or whatever it is and increasing the amount of training, the time and training, quality of training. We're spending more money and a lot more time and resources there. And in fact, we put a Vice President, a guy named Mark Champion, who's been a champion for safety for his entire career into a new role where he is exclusively responsible for safety and quality of training for our aviators. And I think we're leading on that and continuing to push to make the system what is already the safest system in the world even stronger, and I feel good about the path we're on and Mark being charged with that responsibility and having really as many resources as he needed to the one person that doesn't have to live to his budget because he can do whatever he needs to do to make sure that we keep this (inaudible) as we've always been Alison SiderSo when you look in some of your own data, like do you see any kind of trend or any sort of connection between sort of the newness of people and incidents or potential incidents or anything like that?J. Scott KirbyWell, one of the great things about Aviation is we use and we share data. We have great safety systems where our own employees can report without repercussion. ""]",0.6983287

2,1,113,1_loss_united_adjusted_quarter,"['loss', 'united', 'adjusted', 'quarter', 'earnings', 'share', 'demand', 'revenue', 'kirby', 'cents']","['By Rajesh Kumar Singh CHICAGO (Reuters) -United Airlines Holdings Inc on Tuesday forecast a profit for the second quarter and retained its earnings outlook for the full year on ""strong"" travel demand, particularly for international trips. In a statement, CEO Scott Kirby said bookings for international travel are growing at twice the domestic rate. The Chicago-based carrier\'s earnings came days after rival Delta Air Lines played down risks of a slowdown in travel spending, citing record bookings. United said it expects an adjusted profit of 3.50- 4 a share in the second quarter, with a 14%-16% year-on-year jump in revenue. The earnings forecast compares with analysts\' estimates of 3.65 a share, according to a Refinitiv survey. The company also reiterated its forecast for a four-fold jump in profit this year. Its shares were up about 2% in extended trading. Airlines are enjoying robust consumer demand in spite of growing risks of an economic recession. This has allowed them to mitigate rising labor and fuel bills with higher ticket prices. Some analysts are not sure the travel boom will last for long. United last month spooked investors with a profit warning, stoking worries about the industry\'s pricing power. Those concerns were amplified last week when American Airlines Group Inc\'s revised earnings forecast fell short of Wall Street estimates. A manufacturing problem with Boeing Co\'s 737 MAX jets has also cast a shadow on U.S. carriers\' plans to add more flights to capitalize on a busy summer travel season. United did not comment on the potential impact of MAX\'s delays in its earnings report. It reiterated its plans to increase capacity this year. It is one of the most exposed carriers to Boeing\'s delivery delays. The airline has yet to receive nearly three-fourths of its MAX jet order this year. ""The aggressive earnings forecast has been premised on additions of new aircraft to the company\'s fleet,"" said Peter McNally, an analyst at research firm Third Bridge. ""This is entirely dependent on Boeing 737s."" United\'s adjusted loss for the quarter through January came in at 63 cents a share, lower than the loss of 73 cents that analysts had expected, according to Refinitiv data. The company will discuss the results on a call with analysts and investors on Wednesday morning. (Reporting by Rajesh Kumar Singh; Editing by David Gregorio and Lincoln Feast.) ', ""12.

The non-GAAP financial measures are provided as supplemental information to the financial measures presented in this press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and are presented because management believes that they supplement or enhance management's, analysts' and investors' overall understanding of the company's underlying financial performance and trends and facilitate comparisons among current, past and future periods. Non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted operating margin (which excludes special charges (credits)), CASM-ex (which excludes the impact of fuel expense, profit sharing, special charges and third-party expenses), adjusted pre-tax margin (which is calculated as pre-tax margin excluding operating and nonoperating special charges (credits) and unrealized (gains) losses on investments, net) and adjusted net income typically have exclusions or adjustments that include one or more of the following characteristics, such as being highly variable, difficult to project, unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of past or future operating results. These items are excluded because the company believes they neither relate to the ordinary course of the company's business nor reflect the company's underlying business performance Because the non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered superior to and are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP financial measures presented in the press release and may not be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted.

We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure The company does not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking measures where the company believes such a reconciliation would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors and is unable to reasonably predict certain items contained in the GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have not yet occurred and are out of the company's control or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons, the company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements above The information below provides an explanation of certain adjustments reflected in the non-GAAP financial measures and shows a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures reported in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Within the financial tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages and earnings per share amounts presented are calculated from the underlying amounts CASM is a common metric used in the airline industry to measure an airline's cost structure and efficiency. UAL reports CASM excluding special charges (credits), third-party business expenses, fuel expense and profit sharing. UAL believes that adjusting for special charges (credits) is useful to investors because special charges (credits) are not indicative of UAL's ongoing performance. UAL also believes that excluding third-party business expenses, such as maintenance, flight academy, ground handling and catering services for third parties, provides more meaningful disclosure because these expenses are not directly related to UAL's core business. UAL also believes that excluding fuel expense from certain measures is useful to investors because it provides an additional measure of management's performance excluding the effects of a significant cost item over which management has limited influence. UAL excludes profit sharing because it believes that this exclusion allows investors to better understand and analyze UAL's operating cost performance and provides a more meaningful comparison of our core operating costs to the airline industry (due to losses, profit sharing was zero for the periods presented) Three Months Ended March 31,%Increase/(Decrease) 20232022CASM (cents)Cost per available seat mile (CASM) (GAAP)17.4616.794.0Fuel expense4.834.19NMThird-party business expenses0.060.06NMSpecial charges (credits)0.03(0.01)NMCASM-ex (Non-GAAP)12.5412.55(0.1)UNITED AIRLINES HOLDINGS, INC NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (Continued)UAL also reports EBITDA excluding special charges (credits), nonoperating unrealized (gains) losses on investments, net, nonoperating debt extinguishment and modification fees and nonoperating special termination benefits.

The provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2022 is calculated using a discrete effective tax rate method. We determined that applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate to income or loss for the interim reporting period would not provide a reliable estimate for the three months ended March 31, 2022, since small changes in estimated income would have resulted in significant changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate.1 Adjusted diluted earnings per share is a measure that is not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and excludes operating and non-operating special charges (credits) and unrealized (gains) losses on investments, net. We are not providing a target for or a reconciliation to diluted earnings per share, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, because we are unable to predict the excluded items noted above contained in the GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts, and therefore we also are not able to predict the probable significance of such items. "", ""Cost per available seat mile (CASM) increased 4.0%, while CASM-ex2 came in at down 0.1%, better than guidance due to strong operational reliability that produced available seat miles (ASMs) 23.4% higher than the first quarter of 2022. The company remains confident in the 2023 United Next adjusted diluted earnings per share1 target of 10 to 12. I am extremely proud of the United team's performance during the first quarter of 2023. Our industry-leading operational performance contributed to an all-time high operating cash flow in the first quarter and keeps us on track to achieve our cost targets for the full year, said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby. We are watching the macroeconomic risks carefully, but demand remains strong, especially internationally, where we are growing at twice the domestic rate. We expect all of these factors will keep us on track to achieve our full-year adjusted diluted EPS1 target. First-Quarter Financial Results Net loss of 194 million, adjusted net loss3 of 207 million. Capacity up 23.4% compared to first-quarter 2022. Total operating revenue of 11.4 billion, up 51.1% compared to first-quarter 2022. TRASM up 22.5% compared to first-quarter 2022. CASM up 4.0%, and CASM-ex2 down 0.1%, compared to first-quarter 2022. Diluted loss per share of 0.59, adjusted diluted loss per share1 of 0.63. Average fuel price per gallon of 3.33. Reduced adjusted total debt3 by 4.6 billion in the last 12 months. Key Highlights United reached a tentative agreement with the International Association of Machinists amp; Aerospace Workers (IAM) for a new, industry-leading contract for our nearly 30,000 IAM-represented employees. Voting is expected to complete in early May. Today announced the largest South Pacific network expansion ever to and from the continental U.S., including the first non-stop flight between San Francisco and Christchurch (subject to government approval). With 66 flights between the United States and Australia/New Zealand every week, United will operate nearly 40% more flights from the United States to Australia and New Zealand next northern winter versus last year. Launched the United Airlines Ventures Sustainable Flight FundSM, a first-of-its-kind investment vehicle designed to support start-ups focused on decarbonizing air travel by accelerating the research, production and technologies associated with sustainable aviation fuel. Opened expanded and newly renovated global Inflight Training Center in Houston, Texas – the 32 million expansion project more than doubles the available training space and supports the airline's plan to hire and train a total of 15,000 people in 2023, including 4,000 flight attendants. United announced a new industry-leading family seating policy enabled by dynamic seat map technology that makes it easier for children under 12 to sit next to an adult – since launch United enabled almost 50,000 more families to sit with their children. United collaborated with Sesame Workshop to announce Oscar the Grouch as its first Chief Trash Officer as he and the airline celebrate his love of rubbish. United's campaign is designed to promote the expected benefit of using sustainable aviation fuel more broadly. Operational Performance Achieved the lowest first quarter seat cancel rate (1.09%) since the first quarter of 2012, leading the U.S. industry despite the greater impact of weather on United than any other airline.

Non-GAAP Financial Information In discussing financial results and guidance, the company refers to financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures are provided as supplemental information to the financial measures presented in this press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and are presented because management believes that they supplement or enhance management's, analysts' and investors' overall understanding of the company's underlying financial performance and trends and facilitate comparisons among current, past and future periods. Non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted operating margin (which excludes special charges (credits)), CASM-ex (which excludes the impact of fuel expense, profit sharing, special charges and third-party expenses), adjusted pre-tax margin (which is calculated as pre-tax margin excluding operating and nonoperating special charges (credits) and unrealized (gains) losses on investments, net) and adjusted net income typically have exclusions or adjustments that include one or more of the following characteristics, such as being highly variable, difficult to project, unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of past or future operating results. These items are excluded because the company believes they neither relate to the ordinary course of the company's business nor reflect the company's underlying business performance. Because the non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered superior to and are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP financial measures presented in the press release and may not be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Please refer to the tables accompanying this release for a description of the non-GAAP adjustments and reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP financial measures used to the most comparable GAAP financial measure and related disclosures. -tables attached- UNITED AIRLINES HOLDINGS, INC STATEMENTS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED) Three Months EndedMarch 31, % Increase/ (Decrease) (In millions, except per share data) 2023 2022 Operating revenue Passenger revenue 10,274 6,348 61.8 Cargo 398 627 (36.5) Other operating revenue 757 591 28.1 Total operating revenue 11,429 7,566 51.1 Operating expense Salaries and related costs 3,322 2,787 19.2 Aircraft fuel 3,174 2,230 42.3 Landing fees and other rent 717 612 17.2 Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs 702 407 72.5 Depreciation and amortization 655 611 7.2 Regional capacity purchase 615 565 8.8 Distribution expenses 403 226 78.3 Aircraft rent 56 61 (8.2) Special charges (credits) 14 (8) NM Other operating expenses 1,814 1,451 25.0 Total operating expense 11,472 8,942 28.3 Operating loss (43) (1,376) (96.9) Nonoperating income (expense) Interest expense (486) (424) 14.6 Interest income 170 5 NM Interest capitalized 38 24 58.3 Unrealized gains on investments, net 24 — NM Miscellaneous, net 41 19 115.8 Total nonoperating expense, net (213) (376) (43.4) Loss before income taxes (256) (1,752) (85.4) Income tax benefit (62) (375) (83.5) Net loss (194) (1,377) (85.9) Diluted loss per share (0.59) (4.24) (86.1) Diluted weighted average shares 327.4 325.0 0.7 NM Not meaningful UNITED AIRLINES HOLDINGS, INC.

UNITED AIRLINES HOLDINGS, INC NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION UAL evaluates its financial performance utilizing various accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (adjusted EBITDA), adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating margin, adjusted pre-tax income (loss), adjusted pre-tax margin, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share, CASM-ex, operating expenses excluding special charges, adjusted capital expenditures, free cash flow, and free cash flow, net of financings, among others. The non-GAAP financial measures are provided as supplemental information to the financial measures presented in this press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and are presented because management believes that they supplement or enhance management's, analysts' and investors' overall understanding of the company's underlying financial performance and trends and facilitate comparisons among current, past and future periods. Because the non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered superior to and are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP financial measures presented in the press release and may not be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. The company does not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking measures where the company believes such a reconciliation would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors and is unable to reasonably predict certain items contained in the GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have not yet occurred and are out of the company's control or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons, the company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements above. The information below provides an explanation of certain adjustments reflected in the non-GAAP financial measures and shows a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures reported in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Within the financial tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages and earnings per share amounts presented are calculated from the underlying amounts. CASM is a common metric used in the airline industry to measure an airline's cost structure and efficiency. UAL reports CASM excluding special charges (credits), third-party business expenses, fuel expense and profit sharing. UAL believes that adjusting for special charges (credits) is useful to investors because special charges (credits) are not indicative of UAL's ongoing performance. UAL also believes that excluding third-party business expenses, such as maintenance, flight academy, ground handling and catering services for third parties, provides more meaningful disclosure because these expenses are not directly related to UAL's core business. UAL also believes that excluding fuel expense from certain measures is useful to investors because it provides an additional measure of management's performance excluding the effects of a significant cost item over which management has limited influence. UAL excludes profit sharing because it believes that this exclusion allows investors to better understand and analyze UAL's operating cost performance and provides a more meaningful comparison of our core operating costs to the airline industry (due to losses, profit sharing was zero for the periods presented).

UAL believes that adjusting for these items is useful to investors because they are not indicative of UAL's ongoing performance.

UAL also believes that adjusting net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for capital expenditures, net of flight equipment purchase deposit returns, adjusted capital expenditures, and aircraft operating lease additions is useful to allow investors to evaluate the company's ability to generate cash that is available for debt service or general corporate initiatives. Three Months Ended March 31, Capital Expenditures (in millions) 2023 2022 Capital expenditures, net of flight equipment purchase deposit returns (GAAP) 1,843 402 Property and equipment acquired through the issuance of debt, finance leases, and other financial liabilities 200 — Adjusted capital expenditures (Non-GAAP) 2,043 402 Free Cash Flow (in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) 3,142 1,476 Less capital expenditures, net of flight equipment purchase deposit returns 1,843 402 Free cash flow, net of financings (Non-GAAP) 1,299 1,074 Net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) 3,142 1,476 Less adjusted capital expenditures (Non-GAAP) 2,043 402 Less aircraft operating lease additions — 4 Free cash flow (Non-GAAP) 1,099 1,070 Adjusted total debt is a non-GAAP financial measure that includes current and long-term debt, operating lease obligations and finance lease obligations, current and noncurrent other financial liabilities and noncurrent pension and postretirement obligations.

The provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2022 is calculated using a discrete effective tax rate method. We determined that applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate to income or loss for the interim reporting period would not provide a reliable estimate for the three months ended March 31, 2022, since small changes in estimated income would have resulted in significant changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate. 1 Adjusted diluted earnings per share is a measure that is not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and excludes operating and non-operating special charges (credits) and unrealized (gains) losses on investments, net.

Starting Dec. 1, the carrier will begin serving the San Francisco-Christchurch market three times a week using Boeing 787-8 aircraft, becoming the only airline to directly connect the U.S. and New Zealand\'s South Island. United is also adding two new routes from Los Angeles International (LAX) during the winter 2023/24 season, connecting the Californian city with Auckland (AKL) and Brisbane (BNE), Australia. Flights to Auckland will be four times per week from Oct. 28, while Brisbane will be served 3X-weekly from Nov. 29. Both routes will use 787-9s. ""This past winter, United enhanced our network and became the largest carrier to the South Pacific region. Now, this upcoming winter, we will expand even further,"" United senior vice president of global network planning and alliances Patrick Quayle said April 18. In addition to the new routes, United plans to increase frequencies from San Francisco to Brisbane and Sydney. Starting Oct. 28, the Star Alliance member will offer daily flights between San Francisco and Brisbane using 787-9s, up from 3X-weekly, while San Francisco-Sydney will become 2X-daily on 777-300ERs. On the same day, the carrier will also upgauge its daily San Francisco-Melbourne service from 787-9s to 777-300ERs, adding almost 100 extra seats to each departure. Compared to winter 2019, United will offer 65% more seats to Melbourne. Overall, United will operate nearly 40% more flights from the U.S. to Australia and New Zealand next northern winter versus last year. Quayle said that the airline\'s partnerships with Air New Zealand and Virgin Australia would enable passengers to access one-stop connections to more than 50 destinations in the region. United signed a codeshare agreement with Virgin Australia in late 2021, replacing a Virgin Australia-Delta Air Lines alliance that had existed for more than a decade. Data provided by the U.S. Transportation Department shows that United\'s planned San Francisco-Christchurch service will become the first nonstop route between the cities. American Airlines had planned to begin seasonal flights to Christchurch from Los Angeles in October 2020, but operations failed to start because of the pandemic. According to figures provided by Sabre Market Intelligence, O amp;D traffic between Christchurch and the U.S. totaled 84,500 two-way passengers in 2019, all of whom traveled indirectly. Christchurch-Los Angeles was the top city pair, followed by Christchurch-San Francisco. In the Los Angeles-Auckland market, both Air New Zealand and American offered nonstop flights between the destinations before the pandemic, flying 2X-daily and daily respectively, but American has opted not to return to the market. Instead, the U.S. airline operates to Auckland daily from its Dallas-Fort Worth hub. OAG data shows that Air New Zealand is therefore the sole operator of AKL-LAX flights at the present time. However, in January, Delta also announced plans to begin flying the 10,480-km (5,659-nm) sector from Oct. 28, offering daily service using Airbus A350-900 aircraft. In 2019, O amp;D traffic between Auckland and Los Angeles amounted to 195,709 two-way passengers, equivalent to 268 passengers per day each way. The latest figures provided by Sabre for the first 11 months of 2022 show O amp;D traffic of around 47,000 passengers. In the Los Angeles-Brisbane market, United will provide competition for Qantas, which resumed the route in November 2021 after pausing flights during the pandemic.

What is Southwest Pet Travel Policy? If you\'re planning on taking your furry friend on a Southwest Airlines flight, you\'ll need to know the airline\'s pet travel policy. Southwest Airlines makes it easy to include your pet in your travels, but you should know a few rules and guidelines before you go. Southwest allows cats and dogs in the cabin with passengers as long as certain requirements are met. In-Cabin Pets Your four-legged friend must be at least eight weeks old for in-cabin pet travel. They must fit comfortably in a carrier under the seat in front of you. They must weigh no more than 20 pounds. All dogs and cats must be vaccinated appropriately. You\'ll also need to pay a pet fee. As of 2021, the pet fee for a domestic flight is 95 and for an international flight is 150. Pets as Checked Baggage If your pet is too large to fit in a carrier, you must check it as baggage. Unfortunately, you cannot purchase a ticket for a pet checked as baggage. The pet must be checked in as part of your baggage allowance. Those exact requirements apply to pets being checked as baggage. If your pet meets the guidelines, you\'ll need to check in at least 45 minutes before your flight departure and purchase a Pet Fare at the ticket counter. This fare is the same price as a full-fare ticket and allows your pet to travel in the pressurized and temperature-controlled baggage compartment. Pets as Cargo Finally, if your pet is too big for either of these options, Southwest also offers cargo travel for larger animals. This option allows for pets of any size, but you must call Southwest\'s phone number to make a reservation at least 24 hours before your flight. No matter how you decide to travel with your pet, Southwest is an excellent option for you and your furry friend. However, familiarize yourself with their pet travel policy before you go. That way, you can ensure your pet has a safe and comfortable journey. Get the most affordable way out-traveling with Southwest Rapid Rewards!

Switching to non-fossil aviation fuels that produce less net greenhouse gas emissions is key to plans to decarbonise air transport, a significant contributor to global warming. Neste, the largest global producer of SAF, uses cooking oil and animal fat at this Dutch refinery. Sustainable aviation fuels are being made from different sources such as municipal waste, leftovers from the agricultural and forestry industry, crops and plants, and even hydrogen. These technologies are still developing and the end product is more expensive. But these fuels will help airlines reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80 percent, according to the International Air Transport Association. Global output of SAF was 250,000 tonnes last year, less than 0.1 percent of the more than 300 million tonnes of aviation fuel used during that period. It's a drop in the ocean but a significant drop, said Matti Lehmus, CEO of Neste. We'll be growing drastically our production from 100,000 tonnes to 1.5 million tonnes next year, he added. There clearly is demand. The European Union plans to impose the use of a minimum amount of sustainable aviation fuel by airlines, rising from two percent in 2025 to six percent in 2030 and at least 63 percent in 2050. Neste has another site for SAF in Singapore which will start production in April. With the production facilities of Neste in Rotterdam and Singapore, we can meet the mandate for EU in 2025, said Jonathan Wood, the company's vice president for renewable aviation. Vincent Etchebehere, director for sustainable development at Air France, said that between now and 2030, there will be more demand than supply of SAF . - 'Need to mature technologies' - Air France-KLM has reached a deal with Neste for the supply of one million tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel between 2023 and 2030. It has also lined up 10 year-agreements with US firm DG Fuels for 600,000 tonnes and with TotalEnergies for 800,000 tonnes. At the Rotterdam site, two giant storage tanks of 15,000 cubic metres are yet to be painted. They lie near a quay where the fuel will be transported by boat to feed Amsterdam's Schiphol airport and airports in Paris. The Franco-Dutch group has already taken steps to cut its carbon footprint, using 15 percent of the global SAF output last year -- or 0.6 percent of its fuel needs. Neste's Lehmus said there was a great need to mature the technologies to make sustainable aviation fuel from diverse sources such as algae, nitrocellulose and synthetic fuels. Air France CEO Anne Rigail said the prices of sustainable aviation fuel were as important as their production Sustainable fuel costs 3,500 Euros ( 3,800) a tonne globally but only 2,000 in the United States thanks to government subsidies. In France, it costs 5,000 euros a tonne. We need backing and we really think the EU can do more, said Rigail.

However, the Head Office of Arik Air is the Arik Air Aviation Centre in Murtala Muhammed Airport in Ikeja, Lagos State. It presently has over twenty-one aircraft in its fleet, though not the entire fleet is operational. In 2017, the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) assumed control of the airline due to its crippling debts and financial stress. Aero Contractors Company of Nigeria Limited At the onset, Aero Contractors was owned by Schreiner Airways B. V. of Netherlands when it was officially registered in Nigeria. From 1973 until 2004 there were several shareholders of the airline including, Schrenier Airways B.V, which then sold its shares of 40% to CHC Helicopter (CHC), and the prominent Ibru family owning 60℅ of the company. By 2010, the Ibru family assumed 100% ownership, after CHC sold its interests of the company on July 1, 2010. After a drastic industrial action in 2013 that grounded flight operations of the company for eighteen days which resulted in great financial loss, the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria intervened and took over the oversight of the carrier. This move made the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) own 60% of the shares and the rest were in the Ibru family's interest.

There has been a 10% increase in blocked funds recently. The total amount of blocked funds is huge. The trapped fund is one of the things we need to address to move forward."" Per Al Awadhi, IATA had met the Nigerian government in several meetings over the trapped funds, stating that the body would continue discussing the issue with the next government Nigeria promises to address the issue, Emirates makes a vowIn March 2023, Hadi Sirika, the Minister of Aviation, stated the government would accelerate action to release the trapped funds In August last year, Emirates Airlines stopped its operation in Nigeria, citing the trapped funds as the reason Emirates said it would only return to Nigerian airspace if a substantial part of the debt is paid Trapped Funds Foreign airlines begin charging Nigerians in dollarsLegit.ng reported that one of the foreign airlines, Delta Airlines, has already started selling tickets to passengers in Nigeria in US dollars as 551 million belonging to foreign airlines remains trapped in Nigeria. It was gathered that this was to stop the continuous pilling up of the airline\'s trapped funds in the country. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said Nigeria is the most indebted country to foreign airlines globally, with 551 million trapped there. Legit.ng ', 'Chinedu EzeDespite claims in some quarters that foreign airlines may soon shutdown operation in Nigeria as a result of \'trapped funds,\' it has emerged that that many of the airlines have since repatriated their funds from Nigeria. The International Air Transport Association (IATA), had recently said Nigerian government could hamper air connectivity over the non-repatriation of funds by foreign airlines, which would affect the nation\'s economic growth and overall development However, it was learnt that many of the airlines have since collected their funds THISDAY investigation also revealed that many of the airlines have circumvented the process that stipulated they sell their tickets in Naira and opened their foreign currency window for Nigerian travellers to buy tickets. Besides, the airlines are making a kill with Nigerian passengers, selling tickets at price, which is twice the cost of tickets in Ghana for the same destinations According to industry experts. Nigerians pay the highest fares for international travel in the African continent. The Group Managing Director and CEO, Finchglow Holdings Limited and President, Association of African Aviation Training Organisation of Nigeria (AATON), Bankole Bernard, told THISDAY that foreign airlines cannot stop operating to Nigeria because they are making unprecedented profits from the Nigerian route more than they have ever made in the past.""In all ramifications foreign airlines are making so much money from Nigeria now. Their flights are full and they are selling tickets from outside Nigeria. They have upped the exchange rate to N521 per dollar. No foreign airline will leave Nigeria,"" he said. Bernard explained that why Emirates is still not coming to Nigeria was because besides the fact that the airline\'s revenue is still trapped in Nigeria, there is diplomatic row between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Nigeria, which has not really been fully resolved He disclosed that in spite of that Nigerians are still getting UAE visa and hosting events in Dubai noting that UAE was hamstrung in a way because the authorities did not want to give visa to certain categories of Nigerians but the rich who would come and spend money in the country, ""and it is difficult for them to delineate that in their visa conditions.""""UAE had diplomatic row with Nigeria, which has not really been settled. But they are still giving Nigerians visa. A lot of Nigerians are still making their way to UAE. The other day a Chairman of a major bank in Nigeria organised a meeting in Dubai. Many of the airlines are getting their money from the so-called trapped fund. Some airlines bided at higher rate and were paid. So, the trapped fund has drastically reduced. In Ghana you pay 3000 for a destination but in Nigeria you pay 6000 for the same destination. Why we are not complaining is because business is governed by demand and supply. More Nigerians travel than Ghanaians so tickets are in higher demand in Nigeria,"" Bernard who was former President of the National Association of Nigeria Travel Agencies (NANTA), said Industry expert and the General Secretary, Aviation Round Table (ART), Group Captain John Ojikutu (rtd), suggested that foreign airlines should be allowed to pay for their services in local currency to aviation agencies, handling companies and fuel marketers.""They should be allowed by responsible authorities to pay service fees in naira to the services providers and not again in dollars. However, in this situation, the dollar rate will never go down. What really is the reason why the services providers are not made to account for the dollars they earn from the foreign airlines? About 2 billion annually from FAAN (Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria) (PSC (passenger service charge) 100/pax, landing /parking), NCAA (Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority) ( 20/passenger security fees), NAMA (Nigeria Airspace Management Agency) 500/flight(enroute charges)), fuel marketers earn over one billion dollars at 1 a litre and the ground handling service providers, etc. Total of these is more than 3 billion annually; yet they still want shares of the CBN earned forex from other commercial sources,"" Ojikutu said However, the Head of Business Development, Zenith Travels and the spokesman of Aviation Round Table (ART), Olu Ohunayo, said foreign airlines operating into Nigeria have access to three rates now, which include the parallel market, the CBN and the IEA window. He said they get these new rates in conjunction with the CBN.""So, I think that once they have left the official rate, there is the possibility it will be moving closer to the parallel market rate, though not recognized in international business but that is what I am looking at now. And if it keeps moving, then they probably may not have any reason to have issues with remittance. Now they are probably collecting their money in the dollar equivalent. But in the rate before the official rate, you cannot use naira to deal with some transactions because that rate is far lower than the parallel market. So you need to get that official rate from CBN for you to make use of the funds. For now, if they are moving towards the parallel rate now, they can now transact using their country and other businesses to get their naira out,"" he said Ohunayo also stated that foreign airlines are not leaving except those that have issues like Emirates, which cannot pay for its service in Nigeria with naira and became stuck with bringing forex from their own country, which the government might not approve.""It is such airlines that will be the one that will pull out. But for those who have their services operating in Nigeria, and who have their payment in naira, and also with the movement of the IEA rate now towards the parallel market rate, I doubt if anyone of them will leave.""Again, there is a government coming in and they would probably want to wait and watch the government. I know they will all give the government a minimum of about six months to see what line they want to toe. So you can be sure that between now and the end of the year, we probably will not have any airline withdrawing anymore,"" he further said On the high fares Nigerians pay for their flights, Ohunayo said that the fares should not be described as outrageous because the fares are not outrageous.""It is one of the fares on their portal and that is what they have released. For fares to sell, there must be demand, and the only way you can lower the pressure on demand is to increase supply. So if the supply is not coming from international airlines then we should add supply from the domestic airlines. That is the way to beat it. But I encourage other African airlines to operate some of those flights out of Lagos and Abuja,"" he added. ']",0.4921966
23,22,41,22_china_chinese_hong_hong kong,"['china', 'chinese', 'hong', 'hong kong', 'kong', 'beijing', 'china southern', 'hainan', 'southern', 'flights']","['A dispute over airline routes between the US and China has emerged as a further sticking point in efforts to improve relations between the countries after Joe Biden and Xi Jinping agreed stabilising ties was necessary in November. The US has offered to grant Chinese airlines the same number of weekly flights between both countries as American carriers — but only if they agree not to fly over Russia, according to six people familiar with the talks. Moscow banned US carriers from flying over the country after Washington prohibited Russian airlines from flying to the US in the wake of Russia\'s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Chinese airlines are not banned from Russian airspace. US carriers have 12 weekly flights to China, while Chinese airlines have eight to the US. The American carriers face higher fuel costs than their Chinese rivals whose routes over Russia to the US are much shorter. US airlines have lobbied the Biden administration not to grant China more flights because of the cost gap. The shorter route over Russia also allows Chinese carriers the advantage of flying directly to the US east coast. One Chinese embassy official said Beijing\'s proposal to equalise weekly flight numbers — to give both sides 12 — was ""quite reasonable"". He blamed Washington for the stalemate in the negotiations, saying China did not accept that its carriers should have to avoid flying over Russia. ""The slow progress at the moment is not what we want to see. Frankly speaking, the responsibility lies with the US side,"" the official said. ""An issue between the US and Russia is not one between the US and China, even less should it be used as a basis for demanding the so-called \'reciprocity\'."" The Chinese diplomat added that Xi and Biden had agreed on the need for more people-to-people exchanges between the countries when the leaders met at the G20 summit in Bali in November and stressed that more flights were needed to meet that goal. But US carriers, with the support of some members of Congress, want the Biden administration to resist granting the Chinese airlines more flights. American Airlines chief Robert Isom this week told CNBC there could not be an ""unlevel playing field"". ""We have to have the ability to fly the same lengths and not burn more fuel and add time on,"" he said. But he added that he was hopeful Beijing and Washington would find a solution given there was a ""lot of demand"". The National Security Council and Department of State declined to comment on the status of the US-China negotiations. But an NSC spokesperson said they were ""aware"" of the concerns from the US airlines. ""It cannot be business as usual with Russia in the face of Russia\'s illegal war of aggression in Ukraine,"" the NSC spokesperson said. The dispute is the latest thorn in the side of US-China relations, which have hit their worst state since the nations normalised ties in 1979. After Bali, US secretary of state Antony Blinken was scheduled to fly to Beijing, but he cancelled his trip after a suspected Chinese spy balloon flew over the US. The Chinese official said another reason not to accept the US condition about circumventing Russia was that airlines from other countries, such as India and the UAE, flew over Russia without facing repercussions in the US. ""We hope the US side can refrain from politicising the issue and consult with us for a proper solution,"" he said. One American airline executive said US carriers were also pushing back because Chinese carriers cared more about the prestige of multiple flights than having full planes. He said that put US carriers at a disadvantage since they wanted to operate fewer, but fuller, flights to ensure profitably. China wants to increase the number of business visitors as it tries to woo investment from foreign companies after ending its zero-Covid policy. Beijing ultimately wants to see a big increase in the number of flights between the countries but has proposed an increase of four for now. Steve Saxon, head of the Asia travel practice at McKinsey, suggested that one reason US carriers resisted an overall rise in their own flights to China was that they were not suffering from the relatively low number. ""US carriers . . . are short on capacity because of a lack of aircraft and pilots, and are fully deployed on profitable domestic and transatlantic routes,"" said Saxon, adding that South Korean and Japanese carriers were winning from the US-China impasse. Underscoring the slow uptick in flights between the countries, the number of scheduled flights from China to the US in March was only 6 per cent of the level in March 2019 before the Covid-19 pandemic, according to aviation data and advisory provider Ishka Global. In comparison, flights from China to Europe recovered to 23 per cent of their March 2019 level.

It was making reference to the advantageous location of its Seoul hub, for routes between North America and Asia Fast-forward 40-some years and Seoul remains ideally situated for North America-Asia flight connections. One only has to look as far as the Korean Air and Delta Air Lines transpacific joint venture, and the latter\'s decision to funnel U.S.-Asia traffic into Seoul, to see the strength of that location. Tokyo benefits from the same geographic advantage with partners All Nippon Airways and United Airlines, and Japan Airlines and American Airlines, pushing connections over the city\'s Narita and Haneda airports. Seoul and Tokyo\'s geographic strengths as connecting hubs remain unchanged. Now, as air travel in Asia rebounds from the Covid pandemic, western geopolitical tensions with both China and Russia stand to benefit both gateways and their local carriers Pandemic caps on flights between China and the U.S. remain in place amid strained relations between the countries. Before Covid, there were up to 50 flights a day between the countries; today there are only 20 flights per week, Diio by Cirium schedules show. Both Chinese and U.S. airlines want to resume more flights but, as yet, their governments won\'t allow them. At the same time, travel demand between the countries has surged since China eased border restrictions in January. The latest data from the U.S. International Trade Administration show that the number of passengers arriving or departing on nonstop flights with China jumped nearly fourfold to more than 48,000 people in January and February compared to a year earlier when border restrictions were in place. The numbers do not include travelers who connect in a third country, like Japan or South Korea. In January and February 2019, 1.34 million people flew on nonstop flights between China and the U.S.The result is a classic imbalance in supply — of nonstop seats — and demand for U.S.-China travel ANA, JAL, and Korean Air, with their Tokyo and Seoul hubs, sit conveniently in the middle. No other hubs are as conveniently placed. For example, Cathay Pacific Airways\' Hong Kong hub offers similar connectivity but its location adds multiple hours to most trips between the U.S. and China. In addition, none of the three carriers face similar limits on flights or frequencies; in fact, China and South Korea agreed in March to allow for the restoration of all pre-pandemic flights By June, JAL is scheduled to operate 62 percent of its 2019 flights, Korean Air 46 percent, and ANA 22 percent, according to Diio. Note that JAL was half the size of ANA to China before the crisis, and thus has to resume fewer flights to achieve a higher percentage recovered Korean Air, the largest of the three airlines to China before the Covid crisis, will resume more of its schedule as demand warrants and the remaining restrictions ease, a spokesperson said. For example, China still requires a negative Covid test for all arriving travelers, and non-Chinese travelers face a backlog of visa applications. The spokesperson added that, while U.S.-China connecting flows have not fully recovered, Korean Air expects numbers to increase Delta, Korean Air\'s U.S. partner, is limited to just four weekly flights to China — two a week from Detroit, and two from Seattle — according to Diio. That compares to six daily flights in 2019. Delta has resumed its full Seoul schedule of a daily flight each from Atlanta, Detroit, Minneapolis-St. Paul, and Seattle Korean Air routes between Seoul to China (turquoise), and with Delta to the U.S. (purple) in June. (Diio by Cirium)""There is a great increase in the travel flows between China and U.S. connecting via Tokyo, and we expect that this trend will continue if the constraints remain for nonstop flights between China-U S., an ANA spokesperson said. Asked when the airline would resume more of its former schedule to China, they also said additional flights would come back in line with demand ANA has focused on resuming flights to China from Tokyo. These benefit the most from North American connectivity, which the airline has repeatedly said was a priority in quarterly earnings calls. Nonstops to China from Nagoya and Osaka Kansai have not resumed United, like Delta, is operating four-weekly flights to China — all on the San Francisco-Shanghai route — Diio shows. This compares to up to 10 daily flights in 2019. United will operate its full pre-pandemic network to Tokyo by June, with the exception of the Honolulu-Narita route that remains suspended ANA routes between Tokyo to China (blue), and with United to the U.S. (magenta) in June. (Diio by Cirium)A JAL spokesperson similarly said the airline would resume more flights in line with demand. Its partner American is operating four weekly flights to China compared to four daily flights in 2019, Diio shows. American has resumed nonstops to Tokyo from Dallas-Fort Worth and Los Angeles; Chicago-Tokyo flights remain suspended JAL routes between Tokyo to China (blue), and with American to the U.S. (red) in June. (Diio by Cirium)Chinese airlines, which face the same limit on frequencies as their U.S. counterparts, are currently operating just eight weekly flights, according to Diio, two each by Air China, China Eastern, China Southern, and Xiamen Airlines American, Delta, and United have their current schedules in place through the end of October, according to Diio. And some flights, for example American\'s nonstops to Beijing, are not currently scheduled to resume until 2024 ANA, JAL, and Korean Air will offer the first firm glimpse into whether they see a spike in traffic to China — and how profitable that traffic is — when they release their March quarter results around the end of April Subscribe Now to Airline Weekly×You\'ve read 1 of 3 free articlesSubscribe now and get unlimited accessAlready a subscriber?

This has been their business model for almost 2 years. Regularly stranding people on the island of Molokai and other island locations for Days (not hours). This used to be a decent airline until they were handed a Monopoly in 2020 (via an acquisition of Makana Kai Air and the discontinued service by Ohana/Hawaiian Airlines). Mokulele\'s fares are outrageous 109 – 124 (one way). H E L P."" Gail ""We flew from Phoenix to Honolulu Saturday and expected to take an interisland flight to Molokai 3 hours after our mainland flight landed. The flight from HNL to Molokai canceled with no explanation, and we have been stuck here in HNL. They told us the earliest we can expect to get on a flight to Molokai is Wednesday. We are not alone. This has been occurring to many other visitors."" The company has begun acknowledging its problems and said it would help by bringing three more 9-seat planes and one larger aircraft into its fleet over the next few months. Mokulele began in 1994 and was founded by a Native Hawaiian woman, Rebecca ""Kawehi"" Inaba. In 2005 Bill Boyer acquired it, and then in 2007, it began flying in partnership with Mesa Air. In 2008, Mokulele partnered with Republic Airways, at which point it received Embraer 170 jets (pictured above). In 2009, Republic took 50% ownership of the company. Mokulele once even planned to acquire wide-body Boeing 767 planes and wanted to begin flights between Hawaii, Illinois, and London. That never happened. In 2019, Southern Airways Express purchased Mokulele Airlines. Hawaiian Airlines Some New and Missed Opportunities. Your editors have flown on Hawaiian Air hundreds of times, interisland, domestically, and internationally, and it has been mainly without any incidents. We had always counted on them locally as mainlanders do a bus or train for reliable transport. We have known many of the employees (Hawaii is, after all, a tiny place) and have had the opportunity to meet their executive team over the years. Starting in 2022, Hawaiian Air\'s reliability dropped precipitously after many years at 1, down to 5 among major US carriers. That has been primarily due to a combination of earlier staffing issues and a closed runway at Honolulu, their main airport. ATC may play a role as well. Hawaiian Air has been Hawaii\'s bellwether since 1929 and is Hawaii\'s only flag carrier. Hawaiian operates primarily out of Honolulu and Maui, its home bases, and the Big Island and Kauai. The company flies interisland, to the U.S. mainland and Asia, American Samoa, Australia, French Polynesia, and New Zealand. It has a fleet of wide-body A330 and narrow-body A321 planes and uses Boeing 717 interisland. Starting later this year, 10 Boeing 787 Dreamliners will start to arrive, opening many new and longer-range possibilities, including Southeast Asia and Europe. Hawaiian previously flew ATR turboprops as Ohana by Hawaiian, in conjunction with Empire Airlines, which ceased operations. Hawaiian has never incurred a fatal accident or hull loss. Hawaiian Airlines will also begin its new service on May 20 between Honolulu and the Cook Islands. Aloha Airlines is remembered fondly, and here\'s why. Somehow Aloha is never far from our minds. BOH editors have flown on Aloha Airlines countless times. We remember using their coupon books, also flying with many family members and friends, and sometimes paying as little as 29 per flight. We still recall when we could arrive at the airport 10 minutes before a flight and walk right onto the plane. Those were the days! Aloha Airlines began its illustrious journey in 1946 and remained in business for 62 years until 2008. The Aloha brand was among the most highly regarded here in Hawaii, and residents considered it ""the people\'s choice"" interisland carrier for more than six decades. Aloha started as Trans-Pacific Airlines, flying their one DC-3. They would go on to fly DC-3 until 1961. Aloha changed aircraft types multiple times in the sixties before settling in with its familiar Sunbird, Boeing 737-200 fleet. They also tried many other planes, including DC-10 widebodies and Boeing 737-800 ETOPS, and operated routes to places as far as the mainland, Guam, American Samoa, Christmas Island, and Rarotonga. After suffering years of financial woes, Aloha went bankrupt amid many controversies and ceased operations. Subsequently, Mesa attempted to acquire the Aloha brand for its never-in-favor Go! Airlines. A court ruling prevented that, and the brand, other than as a cargo carrier, ceased. Read RIP Aloha Airlines. In that article, we interestingly predicted Southwest interisland service back almost a decade before it actually began. It was in 1988 that Aloha flight 243 suffered the infamous explosive decompression yet managed to land safely on Maui. One of their flight attendants died when she was ejected from the plane, and, in addition, 65 more who were on the flight were injured. At the time, that plane had more than 90,000 cycles (flights), which was more than twice the number of take-offs and landings for which it had been designed. Discovery Airlines was a blip in Hawaii travel. Discovery Airlines operated interisland briefly, for just three months in 1990, and flew the unusual 4-engine BAE 146 jet aircraft. Their demise was associated with having foreign ownership beyond what was dictated by law. FlyHawaii Airlines never got off the ground. FlyHawaii was an airline that never was. It was conceived of by James Delano of Hawaii\'s Lion Coffee fame and was to fly ATR 72 planes (newer variant shown) starting in late 2005. Delano wanted to model it after Southwest and JetBlue by offering frequent flights and relying on online reservations. They had planned to charge 50 per flight. When Go! Airlines began operations, and FlyHawaii abruptly terminated its plans. Go! Airlines was better gone. We only flew on Go! a few times, which was uncomfortable at multiple levels, including both the experience and the company. That\'s a brand that wasn\'t ever much missed here in Hawaii. Go! Airlines (also known as Go Mokulele for a period – see photo) flew inter-island using a less-than-comfortable fleet of CRJ 200 jets operated courtesy of Mesa Airlines. They stopped flying in 2014 after a challenging history that included the two Go! Airlines pilots who fell asleep on the infamous flight to Hilo from Honolulu. They then continued some 25 miles past their intended airport until air traffic control could awaken them. Read about that incident here. Island Air suffered from reliability issues. Alas, another sad story. We loved Island Air and how they treated us as passengers. On the other hand, we had terrible delays on Island Air, and missed connections were always a concern. Towards the end, we avoided them simply for reasons of reliability. Island Air was a highly regarded Hawaii airline that flew Bombardier Dash 8 aircraft and tried moving to the newer Bombardier Q400. It began in 1980 as Princeville Airways and BOH editor Jeff got to fly with them when they first started. The company later expanded to serve most Hawaii airports before being sold and becoming Island Air. It was sold two additional times, first in 2003 to Gavarnie Holdings and later to Lanai billionaire Larry Ellison, who wanted it to expand flights to Lanai island. Ellison sold it to one more time in 2016, which was followed soon thereafter by the termination of Island Air flights. Mahalo Air made it four years. Short-lived Mahalo Air only flew interisland from 1993 to 1997. After acquiring another flight certificate, they started flights on Fokker F27 turboprop planes operated by Empire Airlines (funny coincidence with Go!) and started their own flights using ATR 42 turboprops. Multiple problems plagued Mahalo, and they stopped operations in 1994 after filing for bankruptcy. Makani Kai Air merged with Mokulele. Makana Kai Air flew between Honolulu and both Hoolehua and Kalaupapa (Molokai), Kahului, and Princeville. They also flew between Kahului and Kona after starting operations in 1998. They were known for flat rate fares. Their fleet consisted of Cessna 208 Grand Caravans. In 2013, they suffered from an engine failure on takeoff from Kalaupapa and ditched into the ocean. All of the 10 passengers onboard exited safely, although one person died subsequently. Makani Kai Air merged with Mokulele in 2020, eliminating many of its routes. Mid Pacific Air had 7 good years. Mid Pacific Air flew interisland between 1981-1988 using NAMC YS-11 turboprops and Fokker F28 jet planes. They were a low-cost airline with cargo and 80 passenger flights daily, flying between Honolulu, Kauai, Kona, and Maui. Pacific Wings was a charter airline. BOH editor Jeff once had to charter a Pacific Wings plane to pick up his family on Lanai after they were stranded by another airline. Pacific Wings was a charter company and an interisland carrier based at Kahului, Maui. They started flying scheduled inter-island flights in 2007 and ceased operations in 2013. They flew Cessna 8-seat Grand Caravans between Honolulu, Molokai, Lanai, Maui, and West Maui. They featured 49 fares for every seat. The airline began as a charter operator in the 70s as Air Nevada and, in 1998, became Pacific Wings. In 2009, the troubled airline temporarily suspended flights after a confrontation allegedly occurred between the airline\'s employees and airport police attempting to deliver a citation to the airline\'s president. That was regarding a fuel spill and allegedly improper airport fuel storage. When the company resumed flights shortly after that, it cut service to all but three routes and increased prices. Royal Hawaiian Air Service was better flight-seeing. Rob flew them in 1980 and reported it was incredible because of how low they flew. He says these are flights you wouldn\'t sleep through because of the view. He recalls flying at altitudes of less than 1,000 feet. Royal Hawaiian Air Service (RHAS) flew between Kauai, Lanai, Maui, Molokai, and Oahu. ', 'Hawaiian Airlines can\'t catch a break. Runway construction at its home base, engine supplier problems and other headaches outside its control continue to hamper the carrier\'s return to profitability as it prepares to fly freighter aircraft for Amazon (NASDAQ AMZN) for the first time. The challenges contributed to a 98 million loss during the first quarter, with rising revenues not expected to offset costs until next year, according to financial results issued on Tuesday. Hawaiian Airlines (NASDAQ HA) cargo revenue fell 25% from last year\'s quarterly record as yields decreased with the global drop in shipping demand and a U.S. Postal Service contract for dedicated charter flights expired. Cargo revenue, however, was 16% better than in 2019. Hawaiian lumps cargo together with ""other"" revenue, which fell to 64 million, making it difficult to ascertain the exact amount of cargo sales. A change to a separate line item in earnings reports could be possible once the airline\'s new freight transportation contract with Amazon is fully implemented and cargo becomes more material to the bottom line. Hawaiian plans to begin revenue service for Amazon in the fourth quarter, CEO Peter Ingram said on an earnings briefing with analysts. Amazon is leasing 10 Airbus A330-300 jets and will place them with Hawaiian to fly and maintain under a 10-year contract after they have been converted from passenger configuration to carry large shipping containers. Management has previously said it will receive two of the Amazon-branded freighters this year and ramp up operations as the remainder of the fleet gets delivered during 2024. Hawaiian Airlines will deliver packages to Amazon\'s hub at Cincinnati/North Kentucky International Airport and other destinations in its domestic network. Within days, Hawaiian will be fully ready to maintain A330 jets with its own personnel after completing the transition from a third-party provider, Ingram reported. Delta TechOps currently handles A330 maintenance under a complete fleet services agreement. The move is not directly related to the Amazon business but is designed to reduce overhead and improve fleet reliability, especially as the A330 fleet grows with the addition of the Amazon cargo jets. Hawaiian operates 24 A330 passenger jets. Ingram said insourcing maintenance will reduce ""steady state expenses, giving our team greater control of our day-to-day operation, and allowing us to scale our costs more effectively as we grow the fleet with the Amazon A330 freighters."" Hawaiian has also established a pilot base on the continental U.S. and is hiring about 160 pilots for the Amazon Air operation. Difficult operating conditions The new Amazon partnership portends a boost to future growth. Until then management must still deal with operational challenges that are reducing operating efficiency and revenue opportunities. Five Airbus A321s remain grounded, up from two the previous quarter, because supply chain disruptions are preventing engine supplier Pratt amp; Whitney from securing parts needed for maintenance. The limited availability of the narrowbody jets has forced Hawaiian Airlines to backfill routes with A330s that aren\'t flying to Japan because of slow demand recovery there. The A330s are a poor substitute for smaller markets because they are less fuel efficient, too big for the number of passengers and they don\'t generate any cargo benefit as they do for destinations like Los Angeles or Seoul, South Korea, said Ingram. Hawaiian\'s fuel consumption in the first quarter increased 21.4% over the prior year, in part due to inefficiencies from flying large aircraft in markets suited for the A321, according to the earnings report. Hawaiian is also paying pilots trained to fly the A321 who are sitting around because there aren\'t enough planes. Under its contract with Pratt amp; Whitney, Hawaiian is eligible for penalty payments, but ""those penalties fall far short of covering the financial impact of not having the aircraft,"" said Ingram. The CEO said he expects one aircraft to return to service later this week. Another could be ready a week later. Meanwhile, construction on the main arrivals runway at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu is interfering with Hawaiian\'s on-time performance during peak hours. The project, which began in October and has experienced delays, is scheduled to be completed before the end of May. Air traffic control is managing the situation by holding aircraft on the ground, which has severely impacted Hawaiian\'s inter-island flights in Hawaii. Delays then cascade throughout the day. The airline has added more buffer time in its schedule to try to get back on schedule, but with the return in recent weeks of daylight savings time schedules, ""we have seen performance deteriorate again,"" Ingram said. A rebound in Japan travel, which accounted for a significant portion of the carrier\'s pre-pandemic schedule, has been slow to materialize. The lack of bookings has resulted in underutilized A330 aircraft and pilots. Hawaiian management is compensating for the situation by moving some capacity to U.S. mainland routes that are performing better.

Several commenters dubbed it the ""Spirit Airlines of the Sea."" John Fain and Laura Notarnicola told Insider that they had fun — but probably wouldn\'t go again. A trash can full of used toilet paper, a rusted shower drain, and an unusual smell wafting through the cabin. If there was a ""Spirit Airlines"" in the ocean, the Margaritaville at Sea Paradise cruise might be it, TikTok users said, after travel content creators Laura Notarnicola and John Fain posted a clip on Thursday of their two-night cruise to the Bahamas. The video, with over 7 million views as of Tuesday, features a botched version of the ""Home Alone"" main theme, showcasing the Jimmy Buffet-themed ship\'s features, empty decks, and margaritas. Multiple commenters dubbed the ship the ""Spirit Airlines of the sea,"" a reference to Spirits\' reputation as one of the worst-rated airlines. ""I think my favorite comment was \'I\'d rather go to work,\'"" Notarnicola told Insider. Fain added ""Or the one that says \'the only thing wasting away at Margaritaville is this ship.\'"" Fain told Insider that he believed the video took off because of the Margaritaville name, but also because of a ""stereotype"" that cruises are ""petri dishes."" ""I think the mixture of the brand name versus what people think cruises are and it actually being disgusting was a perfect storm for the video to really pop off,"" Fain said. Fain and Notarnicola, a couple who have been posting travel vlogs and reviews on their account @travelspree since 2020, told Insider that it was their first time going on the cruise, but they don\'t think they would go on it again. Notarnicola said she wouldn\'t recommend people going on it for their first time because it might end up ""putting you off of cruising in general."" Fain said that the couple\'s decision to hop on the Margaritaville at Sea cruise was partly motivated by comments on their YouTube channel. Although they had heard rumors about the 30-year-old ship, they went in with an open mind, saying that they had recently moved to Florida — the ship sails from Port of Palm Beach — and also wanted to get away for the weekend. What they experienced instead was ""jarring,"" Fain said. ""It felt like we were in another universe type of thing, or on a movie set of what a cruise should be and not exactly what we\'re used to on a cruise,"" Fain said. @travelspree TikTok The couple said from the get-go the valet parking situation was confusing, the food wasn\'t amazing, and there were some unsanitary aspects of their stay — including a trash can full of used toilet paper they say was there when they arrived. ""I was trying to show how outdated the bathrooms were. And then that was like a nice little surprise next to the toilet."" Notarnicola said. They also said that despite the cruise\'s cheap price, the add-on expenses for dining and drinks actually ended up costing them a lot. They also said that despite the name, they believed the margaritas tasted like ""straight-up juice."" ""That\'s probably like the least quality cruise that we\'ve been on,"" Notarnicola said. ""But we still managed to have a good time. And obviously, we\'re still thankful that we\'re able to go and do things like this. We realize we\'re very fortunate. But yes, compared to all the other cruises probably not the best."" Margaritaville at Sea did not immediately respond to Insider\'s request for comment. Read the original article on Insider ', ""39Oh, that's great. You've been on vacation. She's hanging out with you. That's what I call team building. We'd like to submit the check for that to management Jaan van Valkenburgh 00 46I'll send it soon Evan Milberg 00 48I would have joined you guys if I wasn't 200 miles away Sean McMahon 00 51Right? Yeah, geez, I guess my invite got lost in the mail. I mean, I only would have had to travel something like 3000 miles to join you for dinner. But if I had made that journey, chances are it would have flown. And that segues perfectly to our guest today. Coming up in a few minutes, we'll be joined by Jill Blickstein, the Vice President of Sustainability at American Airlines. Air travel is a hard to abate industry, and American Airlines is one of the biggest carriers. So Jill has all kinds of sustainability challenges coming her way on a daily basis. We're gonna hear from her about advancements in sustainable aviation fuel, fleet upgrades that include newer lighter braking systems. And my favorite, an AI enabled system called Smart Gating that conserves fuel and saves time for travelers like you and me. American is undertaking numerous initiatives to reduce its carbon footprint. But the biggest takeaway I have from talking with Jill is how many of those efforts come in areas that most travelers never notice. I learned a lot from talking to Jill, and I think you will, too. But for now, let's kick things off with the first regular segment of the show. It's something we call sustainable or suspicious. Evan, I think you've got today's topic for us. So what do you got Evan Milberg 02 12I do. So today's topic is E liability. We have this great article from the Harvard Business Review called getting a clearer view of your company's carbon footprint. And I think the story does just that I think what I really liked about the story is that it's not just some cut and paste advice. It has a real case study from a company called gitI tire, which came across a real problem companies face when trying to improve sustainability, determining how to procure and use emissions data and a pilot study. And verifying the accuracy of that data, I think was crucial to that company's development of an E liability method, which in turn inform strategies to reduce emissions Sean McMahon 02 54All right, well, we'll slow down just one second here. What is e liability Evan Milberg 02 58So the liability Institute defines e liability as an accounting algorithm that essentially allows organizations of all different tiers to produce real time accurate and auditable data on both their total direct and supplier emissions. That's referred to as cradle to gate Sean McMahon 03 19I gotcha. So companies are trying to assess their own so that they can then you know, tout that to customers or competitors,Evan Milberg 03 25essentially, that's my understanding of,Sean McMahon 03 27I can see how this is gonna be really important. And I think we've talked on previous episodes about, you know, the SEC, and disclosure rules that are coming out. And so where companies can acquire or you know, find reliable data is going to be massively important. It's gonna be a huge market, actually, for any of those data firms out there. So I can see why this be very important. Yan, what do you think Jaan van Valkenburgh 03 49I think this is much better than what most of them are doing, which is the GH gap, which does a lot of double counting. Because basically, you're trying to get it from creation, instead of basically an arm's length away. It reminds me of value added tax, when you're looking at different countries, say you, you know, source one material and one country or you, you mine it in one place, and you do it another place, you distribute, and you're putting different costs and you're having to pay tax in each place. Same with transfer pricing for multinationals that have multiple locations and are doing part of that job for that product in each different little place. It's the same concept. And it really works. I'm sure someone will eventually find a way to to cheat at it. But I think this lays a really great foundation on it. And it seems like it has legs. They're doing a lot of articles on it. And one of the authors of it, one of the creators of it has created a Institute at the University of Oxford to I don't know what the resources are for that but they're pushing it I think because it makes a lot of sense. And the same people who know how to do transfer pricing VAT to do all those calculations will be really excellent aides to doing thisSean McMahon 05 10just more work for the lawyers and the accountants, right Jaan van Valkenburgh 05 14And I think eventually, you could end up paying for your carbon this way, just like you pay your transfer, pricing and VAT Sean McMahon 05 24Wow, that'd be quite an advancement. So it's funny, you know, later in the show, we're gonna be hearing from Jill Blickstein from American Airlines. And we talked about that a little bit in our conversation in terms of how companies are trying to keep track of their own carbon footprint, and were to, for lack of a better word attack the most carbon intensive parts of either their supply chain, or they're just overall operations. So you know, a tool like this or an approach like this is definitely something that seems to dovetail well, with, we'll be hearing from Jill. So when it comes to our big test of whether something is sustainable, or suspicious, what do you guys think of this one? Thumbs up,Evan Milberg 05 57it's a thumbs sideways for me. And the reason it's a thumbs sideways for me is it has all of the makings of an actionable case study. But until we actually see it in the field, and other companies following suit, I'm hesitant to say that it's all the way sustainable. Wow,Sean McMahon 06 18you would have been you have been rough in the old Roman Colosseum days. I don't know what happens when the Emperor goes sideways. I don't know what they did back then. I'm gonna say it's, it's sustainable. I think that, like you said, it'll take a while to be adopted widely. But what I sense from the marketplace is that companies like to have a few different options at this point of what tactics or what tools they should deploy. And if this one becomes, you know, the preferred, yet still reliable and credible. I think it gets us there. All right. So now we're gonna move on in the next segment of this show, Karen usually steps in and recounts all the top headlines from the smartbrief on sustainability newsletter, but she's on vacation, and somewhere in the Big Apple having fun, apparently, on, Evan, you're gonna step in and do some double duty for us today. So what kind of headlines we got Evan Milberg 07 09Yeah, so the first story I want to highlight is from an outlet called Israel 21 C. Now, if you're not familiar, Israel, 21 C, covers the way people in that country are innovating at the intersection of science, business and technology. So it highlights one company called criteria innovations, which is doing that by developing sustainable precast products made with locally sourced recycled materials. Just a little side note, locally sourced is the big buzz phrase in concrete right now. So that material has potential for using all sorts of things like wall tiles, cladding, an even some select Load bearing elements and vertical construction in home building. So as our lead editor for the American Concrete Institute's for newsletters soon to be five with us, I've seen a lot of innovative ideas coming out of Israel in recent years. And this is just the latest one. SoJaan van Valkenburgh 08 03this makes me think of a story we ran in civil engineering. About a month ago, a Dutch company called New Horizon urban mining cells building materials gathered from its demolition products Evan Milberg 08 16Yes, c amp;d Waste is going to be, I think, a really big trend in the construction industry in the next decade or so Jaan van Valkenburgh 08 23I think about a quarter of the US waste is considered construction waste, soSean McMahon 08 29well, that sounds great. I mean, what's the next door you got for us Evan Milberg 08 32Yeah, so one of smartbrief sister brands next TV recently reported that Comcast claims its broadband network is 36% more energy efficient than it was just four years ago. Comcast says it consumed 21.2 kilowatt hours of electrical power to deliver a terabyte of data in 2019. But reduce that to just 13.6 kilowatt hours per terabyte and 2022. And this is really interesting considering the various studies on consumer trends that show folks are really aligning themselves with more sustainable brands. I think if this data is packaged, well, Comcast could maybe steal some market share from mainstream competitors and streamers Jaan van Valkenburgh 09 15Well, it's already being packaged in a way that it's on the product instead of the company like most of their competitors do. So I think that is the purpose of these stories. It might have some influence, perhaps not switching people but gaining I think new customers from very young first time customers, because changing your internet provider is is actually kind of stressful. I don't think most people would want to do it Evan Milberg 09 46Not very energy efficient either. I might add itSean McMahon 09 49as if they want to make it hard to change. I just kidding. I don't wanna getEvan Milberg 09 55sustainable Sean McMahon 09 57All right. Well, that sounds great because anything a company decides As Comcast can do to improve their sustainability, that's gonna have a huge impact on pretty much everywhere these days. And and what's the what's the next story you got for us? All right, soEvan Milberg 10 09if you're a listener of this show, you're likely well aware of the so called range anxiety associated with electric vehicles. So our friends at the construction index recently shared a study out of Sweden, that suggests a straightforward solution with a not so straightforward path to implementation, in my opinion, and that's electrifying roads. The researchers are claiming that electrifying roads will allow automakers to drastically reduce the size of EV batteries. Something our friend Frank Menchaca, was talking about a lot a couple of weeks ago. And that's a big deal, given the tenuous nature of the material supply chain and China's subsequent chokehold on it Sean McMahon 10 51So when we're talking about electrifying roads, what are we talking about here Evan Milberg 10 55I've seen some some research out of Purdue on this topic. And my impression here is you're essentially putting conduction technology inside the concrete or the asphalt in a way that where you just drive over the road, it can charge the Eevee in real time Sean McMahon 11 17Okay, I gotcha. Yeah, I think I've heard stories about this in the past as well. Yeah, it'sEvan Milberg 11 21not it's not exactly a new technology. But I think what's novel about the study here is the connection to range anxiety. And essentially how you solve that Sean McMahon 11 32Yeah, I'm gonna jump in and just be a pretty skeptical on this little technology, I gotta say, Sure. Is it possible? Yeah. But I'm just not really seeing a place where all the other part of the payment of all the other moving parts have to fall into place for that conduction to work. All right. The vehicles themselves gotta be able to onboard that. And that's just a whole nother thing. I think there are other ways that range anxiety can be addressed, or there's more charging stations, swappable batteries, quite frankly, swappable cars, that stuff just seems more likely, in my mind, and then some of this cool cutting edge road stuff, because then I think we'd also run into other issues with, you know, maintaining these roads, right. road maintenance around the world is a huge thing. How are you gonna take care of this huge motorway that has this technology embedded in it? I don't know Evan Milberg 12 21Well, and I think that's the criticism of a study like this is what's your timeline for implementation? Because this sounds like something that could be mainstream by, say, 2050. But we're dealing with drastically oversized EV batteries now. So what what is your solution right now. And every day, I feel like we're seeing a lot of stories lately about evey charging stations breaking down very easily, and customers being really frustrated with it. And I think improving those charging stations first, maybe with some of that bipartisan infrastructure, a lot of money would go a long way Sean McMahon 12 59Okay, well, thanks, Evan, I think you did a great job pinch hitting for Karen there. And now it's on to the next segment of our show, here and there. Yan usually kind of takes us somewhere around the world or in some technology that is being used to enhance sustainability. So what do you got for us this week, John Jaan van Valkenburgh 13 22Well, this week, we're going to Western Europe, to look at data centers. So there are three ways to make data centers more sustainable. One is to power them with renewable energy, you should put solar panels on the rooftop, we've seen that. Second is to better manage the cloud data. When workloads are high, you consolidate jobs to a few servers, that can save as much as 30% of energy. But it's not for great for performance. You can also throw out some data. Shawn, you and I were talking a little bit about that earlier Sean McMahon 14 00Yeah, there's a really funny story I saw in tech radar, according to the experts, 41% of data that's saved in data centers is not needed. Like companies hang on to this data, and they never go back and access it. And that really hit home for me, because I know that study was about on the corporate side. But I think every single one of us, like every single person listening to this podcast, just looks himself in the mirror and says, How much data do I have saved somewhere that I'm never, ever going to access Jaan van Valkenburgh 14 31Yeah, that kind of hits home Sean McMahon 14 33I tabulate all my emails. I'm bumping my head on 200,000 emails in my inbox, and I think about almost 150,000 Those I've never read. I'm just too lazy to go through and delete them all. And then don't get me started on like, that's on the worksite right, but don't get me started on like my personal stuff like photos and things like that. I have a Google Drive that I've been paying for for, I don't know, 10 years, something like that. And all the vacations I've gone on all the family gatherings I've ever Add. I mean, gosh, I'd like to tell you that I go back and just scroll through all those photos and videos of when the kids were little and things like that. But man, I very rarely do that. And if I do, it's because Google like, throws it at me and says, Oh, 10 years ago, you were doing this, and I see it. So I'm just as guilty of hogging all the space on these data centers, that's never going to be used. And so stories about this, but how to make them more sustainable or more energy efficient? Yes, there's things they can do on the technology front. But it's also the users have a little bit of responsibility to bear here Jaan van Valkenburgh 15 34Yeah, that 41% really hit me as well. And you're right. But I will say that that figure, they were asking the center people, the data center people, they weren't talking to the owners of the data necessarily, or the data analysts, and you don't know where the correlations between different data points are going to be found. So yes, a lot of data is out there. And it's not being used. But we don't want to get rid of it. Because we're scared, we might need it. And the fact is, we need to start finding some creative solutions. So I have questions about that. 41% I gotcha. I think it depends on who you ask. And by the way, all of my photos are incredibly valuable Sean McMahon 16 17All right. But getting back to what's going on in Western Europe, how are some places tackling this problem Jaan van Valkenburgh 16 22Okay, so you power it differently, you manage it differently, or you locate it differently. And that's what's happening in Western Europe. So the goal of finding a different location for the cloud is to reduce the heat signature, or to recycle the facility heat. And basically, recycling is really where it's at in Western Europe. In Stockholm, the city plans to heat in about 12 years from now. 10th of its homes within the data center. Kete. The organization is called Stockholm data parks. It's private data centers that have partnered with the city with the energy company and with the local grid operator. You've got something similar happening in Paris, where a Parisian climate change Arboretum is being heated by a major data center. In Norway, they have 175 acre office slash business park called lease Parkin, where they're building it with infrastructure underground, that will allow tenants to buy shared energy from data centers. And in England, which has very cold winters, as I remember. So the public pools there have to be heated, because you're in England, you just do a little chilly little too chilly or not. Yeah, yeah. When I first read this article, I was like, Why do they have to? Why would you need a oh, wait a second. England? Yeah, it needs to be heated. Yeah, I would never go into a no, absolutely not. So the public cools, we're going to have to close because of heating costs. And what they found was that they could solve this problem by putting the data centers under the public pools. Everybody wins. Similar thing is happening in Switzerland. So it's just something to consider Sean McMahon 18 17Yeah, I guess you can count me among the people who never thought a datacenter would play a role in keeping public pools open. But a it's a big and wild world out there, I guess. And speaking of the big world out there. Now it's time for our interview with Jill Blickstein, the Vice President of Sustainability at American Airlines. But before we get started, I want to point out that while we're all missing care in this episode, you still get to hear from another smartbrief content expert. That expert is my esteemed colleague, Angie Giroux, and she covers the aviation industry for SmartBrief, so I invited her to join me and Jill for our conversation. I hope you enjoy it. Hello, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. My colleague, Angie Giroux and I are pleased to be joined by Jill Blickstein from American Airlines. Jill, how you doing today Jill Blickstein 19 08Great. How are you doing today Sean McMahon 19 10Great, great. We're here to talk about everything that American Airlines is doing in the world of sustainability. So let's start right from the top. When people think of American Airlines, they think of these big beautiful jets zooming around the sky. And so you know, when you take a fleet wide view on everything your organization's doing, what are some of the steps that American Airlines has taken to become more sustainable Jill Blickstein 19 27So sustainability is a pretty big challenge for aviation. And that means all airlines, particularly big airlines, and American is one of the largest airlines in 2019. Before COVID, we used about four and a half billion gallons of fuel and we emitted about 40 million tons of co2. And so while we're flying some of the more efficient airplanes like the Boeing max and the Airbus 321 Neo, we've been through a big fleet renewal project over the last couple of years. You know, we still burn fossil based jet fuel. And so there's a huge effort going on in our industry and working with fuel producers and governments and others to try to find a replacement or renewable version of that fuel. And so that's something I'm hoping we're going to talk more about today Sean McMahon 20 10Yeah, let's get right into that. I think you're alluding to sustainable aviation fuel, commonly referred to as SAF. So for listeners who might not be familiar with Saf, what is it? How are these fuels created? And just walk us through the basics Jill Blickstein 20 23Absolutely. So the sap that we're using today, we're burning a tiny, tiny bit, I call it about a teaspoon, we're burning a tiny bit of sap today. The stuff that we're buying is made by a company called Nesta based in Finland. And the idea is that you can take waste fats and oils and refine them into a fuel. And when you combine that fuel that renewable fuel with fossil jet fuel at no more than 50% SAF to petroleum jet fuel, and commonly it's blended more like 35 or 30%, the resulting fuel is equivalent to Jet A. And I know a lot of times when I say that people kind of Blink and look at me, like how could that be real, but there's an international standard setting body that actually approves jet fuel, and they approve the technical specifications of jet fuel. And so they've approved with this this fuel made from waste oils and fats is called Heba fuel. It stands for hydro process esters and fatty acids Sean McMahon 21 20That sounds like a whole lot going on there. Okay,Jill Blickstein 21 23that sounds like it sounds a lot like a little too close to food, right. So the nasty fuel that we're buying today is actually made from beef tallow, which is be fat, you know, we blend it and we take it in by ship to the Port of San Francisco. And it goes into the pipeline there, and it's delivered to the airport. So that's the kind of fuel is being made today. And again, it has that blend limit. What's what's amazing about that fuel, is that it can is a drop in fuel. And by that I mean it is dropped into the common tanks and airports, a lot of people don't know, like all the airlines share at big airports, we all share these common tanks, so our fuel goes in. And then obviously, it's mixed with all the other fuel and then it's it's used by every airline, that right, we get credit for the emissions reduction, because we're using it. But think about that, like it's made from beef towel, it goes into the common tanks, and then every airline can fly on it, every aircraft today can fly on it right, we're not making changes to the fueling system, we're not making changes to the aircraft for it. And if you've flown out of San Francisco or LA in the last five years, you've probably flown on a little bit of stuff Sean McMahon 22 25And I understand it's one of the most important things in terms of it being able to be used with any existing infrastructure and existing planes, things like that. Because otherwise, you run into supply issues in which airports are going to have this special kind of feeling which ones aren't. So having it be more of a blend, I guess we'll call it is is crucial, right Jill Blickstein 22 41It's crucial, because we've already put billions of dollars in investments into the fueling system into the pipelines into the tanks, right. And we can't recreate that for a new kind of fuel. So sometimes people will say, Well, you know, I want to, I want to buy SAP and I want it I want this app to go on my plane, I want this app to go into like my route. That's not how it works, right, it's going into common tanks, a little bit is going on to every plane. And that's why we use what's called a bucket claim system. So you know, American bought the fuel or whatever airline bought the fuel, it went into the common tank. So we we get to claim the the environmental benefit of that fuel, but it is going into every we typically don't fuel planes individually. Usually they're their fuel from a common system. And the bottom line on SAF is that on a lifecycle basis, SAF has 75% lower greenhouse gas emissions than petroleum jet fuel 75%. In an industry where we can on a tip on a good year, reduce our emissions by one or half two, or 2% 75% is a very big number. And I would say that as we get better at making staff and as we use newer, more efficient pathways, that number is going to go up. In fact, we expect that eventually we have staff that is reducing our emissions by 90 to 95% Angie Giroux 23 56You've added a lot of clarity there. Thanks for explaining that. smartbrief has included stories in our aviation newsletters about how American Airlines is looking to have 10% of fuel BSA f by 2030. Can you update us on American's progress on reaching that goal Jill Blickstein 24 15Absolutely. So roughly speaking, if we're burning about 5 billion gallons of jet fuel in 2030, our goal is about 500 million gallons of, of SAF by then and let me just put that in context a little bit for you. So last year, we probably burned more staff than any other airline. I don't have definitive figures on this yet, but it's about 2 million gallons, you know, in a year where we probably use three and a half to 4 billion gallons of jet fuel. So it really is a tiny amount. And there's very little staff available in the marketplace today. Now that's going to change, right? We're learning about new production facilities coming online. We're helping to get some of those facilities built as lots of airlines are looking to Do this. And the new provisions of the inflation Reduction Act there is a special blenders tax credit for the very first time. So that's drawing new production and interest in investment into the United States and South. We have two contracts one with a company called a meet us and another with a new company, a company called GMO, who make all kinds of renewable chemicals and fuels and are starting to get into the Saft business. So we have definitive agreements to purchase about 220 million gallons of sap in 2030. And so we're about to a little more than 20% of the way towards our goal in 2030. What's interesting about that is when we go to sign contract, there's two things I want to mention when when we go to sign contracts for staff, one of the things that's really different is we're signing contracts with companies who haven't built their plants yet. And just think about how different that is from how we normally fuel right, we're normally buying fuel from the oil majors fuel. Jet fuel is a super commodity, incredibly liquid, we trade with airlines, we trade with airports like it's, it's a very well oiled machine, right, no pun intended. Whereas now we're buying stuff from people who haven't made jet fuel yet. So it's just a very uncertain kind of endeavor. And of course, all the stuff in the world, most of the stuff in the world is being delivered into California, because California has a financial incentive. So it's cheaper to deliver stuff into California. Well, at some point, we're all going to run out of California capacity. That will be I think that will be a high quality problem. I'm excited forSean McMahon 26 22that day. Okay, now, you mentioned California a couple of times now, and you know, flights out of LA or San Francisco, or you're probably using Southfield for that, or sorry, I guess if fuel is redundant, isn't it? Sorry. Anyway, so I want to ask you a question. I do a lot of stories on the finance side, and a lot of companies are trying to, you know, the SEC is going to be coming out with some disclosure rules, right? Where companies need to track their mission, scope one, scope two, scope three. And I know you already mentioned that, like some people, you put a little bit in every plane, so you can't really ask for a route that has the most staff. But do you see a future where that might be the case, particularly for routes that are maybe more relying on business travelers? Or if I'm Google, and I'm flying a bunch of people up and down from LA to San Francisco and back, you know, or wherever, maybe on the East Coast, it's going to be New York to DC or New York to Philly or somewhere like that? Do you see a future where that segment of passengers will want to make sure that their executives are there people are flying on planes, where they can then track Hey, we're, we're using an airline American is offering more staff than any other competitors. So we're going on American because American allows us to check that box or report that part for the SEC, is that something that's just too pie in the sky? Am I just dreaming? Or is that something you think might become a reality, I thinkJill Blickstein 27 33that's gonna become a reality. So I share that dream with you. It will not be that South is on my plane. But it will be the case that you if you're a big company, or that wants to reduce your emissions from your employees traveling, you will be able to come to me and by the emissions reduction value of staff. And I say it that way. Because if you're a company Company X, and you want to be able to reduce your emissions, you don't want to buy fuel from me, right? You want to get the credit from having flown on staff. And when I say flown, I mean that as an image not as an as a reality. Right? So if American has bought 2 million gallons of sap, let's say or is using 2 million gallons of sap, you can then buy the image emission reduction value of that. And that's because of how the scopes work. Right. So let's just take one minute to talk about scope one and scope three, right? Scope. One are the direct emissions. When I American Airlines, USAF, I take the scope one emissions reduction, because it's made from renewable source. But I have also incurred a scope three emission for the business travelers who traveled with us. So American burning jet fuel is not your direct emission, it's your indirect emission, it's your upstream or downstream. I get confused which one it is. So I can still take the scope one emission reduction for SAP and you can take the scope three at the same time. That's double counting. But that double counting is built into carbon accounting. carbon accounting was meant to have this because the people who created it wanted me the airline to have an incentive to reduce my emissions. And they wanted you my customer to talk to me about reducing my emissions. Does that make sense Sean McMahon 29 14Yeah, absolutely. That's the symbiotic relationship. I hate using that word. Because I seem I feel so cheesy, but it's a symbiotic relationship that the policymakers are trying to generate, right Jill Blickstein 29 23Yes, they want you to pressure your supply chain. And they want me to pressure my supply chain too. So I'm now talking to my jet fuel producers about how they can reduce their emissions in the production of jet fuel. So we're all supposed to be pressuring all of our supply chains. And in that way, we really will get more serious emissions reductions Sean McMahon 29 41So that takes you back to what you're saying earlier about house. You're exploring relationships with manufacturers, you haven't even built the plant yet. So now you can have some insight or input on how they create that plant and build it and operate it right. Yes Jill Blickstein 29 53And I'm also having conversations with my customers, you know, we've sold, we've done exactly what you've been talking about. We have actually sold the emission reduction To the value of sustainable aviation fuel to a set of corporate customers who themselves have, for example, science based targets, they really need to reduce their scope three. And a company like Deloitte, for example. They don't have a lot of direct emissions, they have a lot of scope three, because they travel a lot. And so we actually approached them and said, we want to test out this new, this new way of transacting with Saf, right? Because eventually we want to do is create a SAS certificate. That's the end goal, so that you as even if you're a leisure traveler, you're going on vacation with your family, but you want to offset your emissions, maybe you could buy a carbon offset, or maybe you want to buy, you want something that's actually in the airline business, you actually want to buy the emission reduction value of staff, you one day, you will be able to go buy a staff certificate. Wow Sean McMahon 30 45It's incredible even just to take the family on vacation Angie Giroux 30 47Yes, it's good stuff. Seems like there's a lot of great opportunities going on for staff. We've been hearing about zero Abia and other ways American Airlines is investing across the industry to reduce his carbon impact. Can you tell us a little bit more about those efforts Jill Blickstein 31 03Absolutely. So we have a goal to reach net zero emissions by 2050. And we do have a science based target approved for 2035 as well. So we have to reduce our emissions very significantly, at least by 2035. And obviously thereafter, if we're going to meet the goals of the Paris agreement, we have a plan that we've laid out for how we're going to do that, which relies a lot on SAF and on new modes of propulsion, and on having the newest aircraft and engines. So new propulsion, we've invested in two companies, one is their Avia, and another is universal hydrogen, both of whom are working on hydrogen propulsion for aircraft. Now, hydrogen propulsion is not new, the military flew on hydrogen in the 1950s, I think. But the modern version of it using fuel cells is really in its infancy. And I will say, you know, I've been doing this role for about three years. And in that three years, I've seen a huge amount of acceleration, right, we got the soft tax credit, we're seeing a lot more soft production, we're seeing hydrogen has gone from something that people said was impossible. Now, both those companies have done have performed test flights using a hydrogen fuel cell actually burning hydrogen, and to make electricity to power the rotors. So zero Avia wants to create first very small regional planes. And you know, obviously start small so that we can go to something bigger, and universal hydrogen did a test flight, they are going to do a retrofit for small regional planes at the beginning, although these are more like I think, 40 to 50 seater. So that's a decent sized plane. And then what they what they want to focus on is the hydrogen, the logistics of hydrogen fuel delivery to airports. So this was something we talked about at the beginning. You know, SAP is great, because you don't have to create a whole new logistics system. The idea, we also probably can't create a whole new hydrogen logistics, infrastructure. But what they're what universal hydrogen is doing is creating capsules that can contain the hydrogen that can be moved by truck easily from airport to airport or among airports. And that can be loaded pretty easily onto the plane. So you're not talking about creating a whole new fueling system. And so American Airlines is investing in both sides, I call it of the hydrogen, what will become the new hydrogen ecosystem, right? It's having a new hydrogen propelled plane. And it's having a way to deliver the fuel that is low emission and efficient Sean McMahon 33 24Okay. And speaking of other initiatives, or other, you know, efforts that American's making, I saw you got y'all are interacting with the Bill Gates led Breakthrough Energy ventures, what's that relationship look like? And how did it get started Jill Blickstein 33 35So we are a anchor partner of Breakthrough Energy catalysts. So Breakthrough Energy has a bunch of different companies in it. One of them is Breakthrough Energy ventures, which is obviously doing venture investing catalysts. The goal of catalyst is to provide low cost capital, to companies and projects that are positioned to scale. So it's not super early investing. It's investing in technologies that work in the lab. And that and we're these companies need extra capital, we need capital to build to actually get to scale. So it's very kind of purposeful, we've been looking around for a strategic partner on sustainability. Because, well, obviously, airlines don't make fuel right? We don't make airplanes we go to OEMs. And we ask them to make us airplanes and engines and all these other things, right? We don't make we don't make all the stuff we eat fly the airplane. So we're not. I wouldn't call us like the experts in making any of those things. And so we were looking for a partner who shared our goals, but could help us make the smart choices about where to invest. So we have 100 million commitment to Breakthrough Energy catalyst. Catalyst has already made an investment in Lonzo jet, which is a staff producer in the United States. It's going to make alcoholic jet staff meaning they're going to make staff using ethanol, and they needed the catalyst financing to build their test plant. So it's only the test plant is gonna make about 10 million gallons a year I think, but once they get the technology right and the test plant, then they can go build bigger plants and that is sort of A great test case for how we want catalysts work Sean McMahon 35 02Well, that sounds great. I'd love to get an update from you down the road about other kinds of smaller ventures that are getting bigger through the catalysts. So we'll try to follow up with you on that Angie Giroux 35 10Jill, can you talk a little bit about American's plan to transition aircraft from steel to carbon fiber breaks Jill Blickstein 35 17Yeah, so this is interesting, you know, the most brakes on planes are made from steel, which is pretty heavy. And the military actually pioneered the use of carbon brakes. Because they were lighter, they could absorb more energy, and they lasted longer, they were also more expensive. Now, I think because of innovations in technology, that price has come down somewhat, but also because they're lighter. And they last longer, right, there's a return on investment there. So we have recently begun a plan to purchase carbon brakes from saffron for our 737 fleet. And we're going to save lots of fuel and lots of emissions. And that's one of the things we can do in our operation, right? And we're looking at things like that we probably have a list of 20 or 30 Different things that we're we're always in in the mode of pricing out when can we get a return on the investment in these things? How will they help our operation? Where can we save on maintenance? You know, one thing that we did in the last couple of years, we invested in a new application, you know, the pilots now instead of having to have these big books of directions and instructions, they now get lots of the information they need to operate the flight on their iPad, right? That's the new flight bag is the iPad, and through the Wi Fi on the plane, we're delivering real time weather information to pilots. So they're constantly are able to check on an ongoing basis. Has the weather changed? Are we seeing a storm are we seeing turbulence and turbulence obviously, is a critical safety issue, but also very important to fuel burn. And so pilots now see a very clear screen that shows them where where turbulence is and shows them how to change their route and usually a slight change in altitude to avoid an area of turbulence. And we have saved millions and millions of gallons of jet fuel by giving pilots this new tool in the cockpit Sean McMahon 37 02Again, it sounds like something that passengers might not really realize is happening in the cockpit, but it is enhancing their travel experience Jill Blickstein 37 08Exactly, exactly. I mean, just like the lighter paint, you know, we're putting lighter pain that lasts longer on our aircraft, passengers aren't going to really see that or recognize the value of that. But it also saves fuel. I mean, that's, you know, the technologies that we started talking, you started out talking about the staff and the and the new propulsion, those are going to come really upscale, it's going to take probably a decade for those to really come on sale. So what we're doing, we're doing everything we can in our operation today to save fuel. In the end, it's going to save us, you know, one to 2% I'd say of jet fuel of our of our jet fuel on our emissions, whereas SAF and new propulsion, the new propulsion, if we can grow the industry for green hydrogen, that could be zero emission flying Sean McMahon 37 51Yeah. And he said the prospect or the potential that zero emission flight is even, you know, even more breathtaking, I guess you'd say, it's even better. It just occurred to me, a lot of the things we're talking about right now are things that passengers might not notice. Right. You mentioned, like, you know, you might not even know if your plane is, you know, powered by staff or percentage of staff, and some of these other things that are going on behind the scenes. But what are some of the things just from a sustainability perspective, or, you know, conserving fuel or just reducing carbon emissions? What are some of the things that American's working on that passengers might see or might benefit from directly, and it's really kind of putting it in front of them rather than behind the scenes Jill Blickstein 38 25You know, you're absolutely right, that customers don't see the most important things that we're doing to reduce our impact on the planet. And so everything from the fuel, I mean, obviously, they'll see it when they're boarding a whole new kind of aircraft, for example. But there's a lot of other things we do in our operations that have a big impact. And I'd love to talk about those in a bit as well. What they do see are the plastic cups and the plastic cutlery and the plastic wrap on their food and all of that and we are working to reduce that. I say that with some hesitancy because I think during we had a lot of plants before COVID. And COVID just took everyone you know, we weren't allowed to hand the can of coke to the passenger anymore, right in COVID. So it really put a stop to a lot of the things we were trying to do. Lots of those things have been reintroduced. We are recycling more, we've picked up the recycling. We've replaced plastic cutlery with bamboo cutlery and lots of lights. Before COVID We got rid of the plastic stirring sticks and the straws. Of course, we're an airline. So we couldn't get rid of all the straws. I think we still have one or two straws for people who need them. But we were able to get rid of most of the straws. And we're very big. So when we go to replace something, we have to have a supply chain that can really deliver that product to us. And so yes, we're making we're making progress and our customers should should be seeing on their flights, lots of new products that might look a little bit different than the products that we're used to seeing Sean McMahon 39 47So I was on your website doing a little bit of research ahead of this and I did see something that caught my eye and it's called Smart Gating. And I think every traveler can relate to the feeling of you know, you've landed at your destination, your taxi Then over to the concourse. But then the pilot comes on and says, Oh, well, we got to sit on the tarmac because we don't have any gates to park at right now. So it sounds like American's working on smart gating is something that American's working on to try to fix that. Can you describe what smart gating is for our listeners Jill Blickstein 40 17Yes, absolutely. So assigning planes to gates was a manual process. And it took four hours, this is my favorite part, it took four hours every night between 10pm and 2am, that the dispatch team had to sit down and like map out where every plane was going to gate. And then as soon as something went wrong, they had to fix it completely fixed the plan, right, because it all every flight cascades to the next slide, what we did was we used, we built internally, a machine learning application that sits on top of the existing application and takes that four hours down to basically like two and a half minutes that it takes to actually assign. And of course, you know, the teams went out to every airport to learn all the intricacies of what you want to do is, you know, lay in the plane, probably at the gate that is well positioned for the next flight, right. So that's also saving you saving you time and money. In the end, what it's done, we've deployed it at DFW and at Dallas Fort Worth, and at the Charlotte airport, which are two of our biggest hubs in the United States. And it's already saved us a million gallons of fuel by reducing taxi time by about two minutes. So those two minutes that you're sitting there wondering, if you're like driving into the next state, that ride is gonna feel shorter, and it's gonna burn less fuel, and it's gonna save a lot of emissions Sean McMahon 41 23You said, it's a machine learning tool, and we live in a world where it seems like AI is a bad word these days. But are you suggesting, Jill that there's AI being put to good use, is that what you're trying to tell us Jill Blickstein 41 31That's exactly what I'm trying to tell you. There are lots of very complex operations at an airport. If you ever get a chance to get a view of what airport operations look like our COO showed us one of those fast action films where they speed up all the action, you can see what it really takes to get an airplane off the ground. It's multiple teams working on multiple in sequence, right. And so much has to happen. And so much has to happen in the right sequence and fast for us to turn an aircraft and so anything we can do like like smart gating, where we're using these new tools, you know, the all those people who were spending four hours trying to assign planes to gates, think what they can do now, with that time, and that freed up brain power. So it's pretty exciting Angie Giroux 42 13I think it's fascinating technology I'm picking it really does, you know, enable a smoother travel experience for passengers. Okay, ISean McMahon 42 20was looking at your website, when in terms of you know, operations that are powered by renewables. There's something in there about how your your corporate headquarters, I think at DFW is 100% renewable Jill Blickstein 42 29Yes, we are purchasing renewable energy certificates to offset all of our electricity use in our North Texas facility. So that includes our headquarters and our integrated operating center, and our training facilities, and obviously the airport as well. And we're talking to all of our airports about how we can work together to reduce fuel use to reduce electricity use electricity, the emissions from purchase electricity are less than 1% of our total emissions. So because we burn so much jet fuel jet fuel is really the focus of our work, but we haven't lost sight of the need to also reduce our electricity use Sean McMahon 43 02Now, I want to circle back to something you mentioned earlier about how American you know has its carbon emissions targets validated by the science based targets initiative. Can you explain to our listeners what that is and how that process took place Jill Blickstein 43 13So the science based targets Initiative is a set of environmental nonprofits, I think its World Wildlife Foundation CDP World Resources Institute, they saw that lots of companies were trying to set netzero goals and emissions reduction goals. And they also saw that investors and customers were struggling to understand how one company's goals compared to another company's goals. And if those goals had any science behind them, me now we have the Paris Agreement. Now we have the IPCC reports telling us what we really need to do to reduce emissions to meet the goals of the Paris agreement to essentially arrest global warming. So what they did was they came up with this rubric they call science based targets. So for example, they will tell companies, they have they published a pathway. So companies needed to be able to route that reduce their emissions on a certain path, to be able to get to zero by 2050. And they call that so that's a ScienceBase. Target for for 2050. And they said to companies, okay, you want to publish a pathway or a target and you want our blessing. You submit your target to us, and we will review it, and we'll tell you if it meets our criteria. And what I've read is that they thought nobody was going to want to do this. And it turned out that hundreds and hundreds of companies wanted to do this, because companies face the same problem, right? They wanted to set a emissions reduction goal, they want to show that they're taking climate change seriously. And they needed external validation. And so the whole idea of the science based target initiative, I think, kind of exceeded the expectations of the people who set it up. So they they have been growing the initiative and for a long time, airlines could not even apply because all the emissions reductions targets from sbti. They were all absolute. So they said you have to get Your emissions absolutely down by whatever percent by let's say 2035. They realized that it wasn't appropriate for every industry. Because as we grow, our emissions are going to grow. And because we don't have near term ways to really cut our emissions significantly, right, because we don't have satphone. We don't have new propulsion yet. Just realSean McMahon 45 20quick, just to explain to listeners, so some industries have ready made solutions that are or at least really close to being ready. Other industries, whether it's airlines or shipping or whatever, little farther away,Jill Blickstein 45 31yeah, airlines and shipping are called hard to abate. Very hard to evade, not really the moniker you want to have. Whereas think about like road transport is decarbonizing today with electric trucking can decarbonize by using renewable diesel, which is made from the same feedstocks, the same inputs that SAP is made from, I like to say I'm a little jealous of road transport, although the bonus is that as road transport decarbonize, it's going to free up that ethanol production. And maybe we can, we're on a path to be able to reuse that ethanol to make stuff. So that's pretty exciting. So going back to the sinespace, target for a minute. So what they would what they did was they realized they had to create unique pathways for these hard to evade industries. So I think oil and gas has what aviation we have our own pathway, it's a reduction in carbon intensity. So think about it as emissions per seat, for example. And we have to reduce our emissions essentially proceed by about 45% by 2035. So it's far away. It's a drastic cut. But that's we expect SAF to be really scaling by 2030. And we expect to have be able to take advantage of cost competitive stuff in the 2030s. And we expect hydrogen propulsion to be well on its way by that as well Sean McMahon 46 45Wow, that would be incredible. That's for sure. All right. Well, hey, Jill, listen, this has been a fascinating conversation. Thank you so much for your time. We really appreciate it Jill Blickstein "", ""39Oh, that's great. You've been on vacation. She's hanging out with you. That's what I call team building. We'd like to submit the check for that to management Jaan van Valkenburgh 00 46I'll send it soon Evan Milberg 00 48I would have joined you guys if I wasn't 200 miles away Sean McMahon 00 51Right? Yeah, geez, I guess my invite got lost in the mail. I mean, I only would have had to travel something like 3000 miles to join you for dinner. But if I had made that journey, chances are it would have flown. And that segues perfectly to our guest today. Coming up in a few minutes, we'll be joined by Jill Blickstein, the Vice President of Sustainability at American Airlines. Air travel is a hard to abate industry, and American Airlines is one of the biggest carriers. So Jill has all kinds of sustainability challenges coming her way on a daily basis. We're gonna hear from her about advancements in sustainable aviation fuel, fleet upgrades that include newer lighter braking systems. And my favorite, an AI enabled system called Smart Gating that conserves fuel and saves time for travelers like you and me. American is undertaking numerous initiatives to reduce its carbon footprint. But the biggest takeaway I have from talking with Jill is how many of those efforts come in areas that most travelers never notice. I learned a lot from talking to Jill, and I think you will, too. But for now, let's kick things off with the first regular segment of the show. It's something we call sustainable or suspicious. Evan, I think you've got today's topic for us. So what do you got Evan Milberg 02 12I do. So today's topic is E liability. We have this great article from the Harvard Business Review called getting a clearer view of your company's carbon footprint. And I think the story does just that I think what I really liked about the story is that it's not just some cut and paste advice. It has a real case study from a company called gitI tire, which came across a real problem companies face when trying to improve sustainability, determining how to procure and use emissions data and a pilot study. And verifying the accuracy of that data, I think was crucial to that company's development of an E liability method, which in turn inform strategies to reduce emissions Sean McMahon 02 54All right, well, we'll slow down just one second here. What is e liability Evan Milberg 02 58So the liability Institute defines e liability as an accounting algorithm that essentially allows organizations of all different tiers to produce real time accurate and auditable data on both their total direct and supplier emissions. That's referred to as cradle to gate Sean McMahon 03 19I gotcha. So companies are trying to assess their own so that they can then you know, tout that to customers or competitors,Evan Milberg 03 25essentially, that's my understanding of,Sean McMahon 03 27I can see how this is gonna be really important. And I think we've talked on previous episodes about, you know, the SEC, and disclosure rules that are coming out. And so where companies can acquire or you know, find reliable data is going to be massively important. It's gonna be a huge market, actually, for any of those data firms out there. So I can see why this be very important. Yan, what do you think Jaan van Valkenburgh 03 49I think this is much better than what most of them are doing, which is the GH gap, which does a lot of double counting. Because basically, you're trying to get it from creation, instead of basically an arm's length away. It reminds me of value added tax, when you're looking at different countries, say you, you know, source one material and one country or you, you mine it in one place, and you do it another place, you distribute, and you're putting different costs and you're having to pay tax in each place. Same with transfer pricing for multinationals that have multiple locations and are doing part of that job for that product in each different little place. It's the same concept. And it really works. I'm sure someone will eventually find a way to to cheat at it. But I think this lays a really great foundation on it. And it seems like it has legs. They're doing a lot of articles on it. And one of the authors of it, one of the creators of it has created a Institute at the University of Oxford to I don't know what the resources are for that but they're pushing it I think because it makes a lot of sense. And the same people who know how to do transfer pricing VAT to do all those calculations will be really excellent aides to doing thisSean McMahon 05 10just more work for the lawyers and the accountants, right Jaan van Valkenburgh 05 14And I think eventually, you could end up paying for your carbon this way, just like you pay your transfer, pricing and VAT Sean McMahon 05 24Wow, that'd be quite an advancement. So it's funny, you know, later in the show, we're gonna be hearing from Jill Blickstein from American Airlines. And we talked about that a little bit in our conversation in terms of how companies are trying to keep track of their own carbon footprint, and were to, for lack of a better word attack the most carbon intensive parts of either their supply chain, or they're just overall operations. So you know, a tool like this or an approach like this is definitely something that seems to dovetail well, with, we'll be hearing from Jill. So when it comes to our big test of whether something is sustainable, or suspicious, what do you guys think of this one? Thumbs up,Evan Milberg 05 57it's a thumbs sideways for me. And the reason it's a thumbs sideways for me is it has all of the makings of an actionable case study. But until we actually see it in the field, and other companies following suit, I'm hesitant to say that it's all the way sustainable. Wow,Sean McMahon 06 18you would have been you have been rough in the old Roman Colosseum days. I don't know what happens when the Emperor goes sideways. I don't know what they did back then. I'm gonna say it's, it's sustainable. I think that, like you said, it'll take a while to be adopted widely. But what I sense from the marketplace is that companies like to have a few different options at this point of what tactics or what tools they should deploy. And if this one becomes, you know, the preferred, yet still reliable and credible. I think it gets us there. All right. So now we're gonna move on in the next segment of this show, Karen usually steps in and recounts all the top headlines from the smartbrief on sustainability newsletter, but she's on vacation, and somewhere in the Big Apple having fun, apparently, on, Evan, you're gonna step in and do some double duty for us today. So what kind of headlines we got Evan Milberg 07 09Yeah, so the first story I want to highlight is from an outlet called Israel 21 C. Now, if you're not familiar, Israel, 21 C, covers the way people in that country are innovating at the intersection of science, business and technology. So it highlights one company called criteria innovations, which is doing that by developing sustainable precast products made with locally sourced recycled materials. Just a little side note, locally sourced is the big buzz phrase in concrete right now. So that material has potential for using all sorts of things like wall tiles, cladding, an even some select Load bearing elements and vertical construction in home building. So as our lead editor for the American Concrete Institute's for newsletters soon to be five with us, I've seen a lot of innovative ideas coming out of Israel in recent years. And this is just the latest one. SoJaan van Valkenburgh 08 03this makes me think of a story we ran in civil engineering. About a month ago, a Dutch company called New Horizon urban mining cells building materials gathered from its demolition products Evan Milberg 08 16Yes, c amp;d Waste is going to be, I think, a really big trend in the construction industry in the next decade or so Jaan van Valkenburgh 08 23I think about a quarter of the US waste is considered construction waste, soSean McMahon 08 29well, that sounds great. I mean, what's the next door you got for us Evan Milberg 08 32Yeah, so one of smartbrief sister brands next TV recently reported that Comcast claims its broadband network is 36% more energy efficient than it was just four years ago. Comcast says it consumed 21.2 kilowatt hours of electrical power to deliver a terabyte of data in 2019. But reduce that to just 13.6 kilowatt hours per terabyte and 2022. And this is really interesting considering the various studies on consumer trends that show folks are really aligning themselves with more sustainable brands. I think if this data is packaged, well, Comcast could maybe steal some market share from mainstream competitors and streamers Jaan van Valkenburgh 09 15Well, it's already being packaged in a way that it's on the product instead of the company like most of their competitors do. So I think that is the purpose of these stories. It might have some influence, perhaps not switching people but gaining I think new customers from very young first time customers, because changing your internet provider is is actually kind of stressful. I don't think most people would want to do it Evan Milberg 09 46Not very energy efficient either. I might add itSean McMahon 09 49as if they want to make it hard to change. I just kidding. I don't wanna getEvan Milberg 09 55sustainable Sean McMahon 09 57All right. Well, that sounds great because anything a company decides As Comcast can do to improve their sustainability, that's gonna have a huge impact on pretty much everywhere these days. And and what's the what's the next story you got for us? All right, soEvan Milberg 10 09if you're a listener of this show, you're likely well aware of the so called range anxiety associated with electric vehicles. So our friends at the construction index recently shared a study out of Sweden, that suggests a straightforward solution with a not so straightforward path to implementation, in my opinion, and that's electrifying roads. The researchers are claiming that electrifying roads will allow automakers to drastically reduce the size of EV batteries. Something our friend Frank Menchaca, was talking about a lot a couple of weeks ago. And that's a big deal, given the tenuous nature of the material supply chain and China's subsequent chokehold on it Sean McMahon 10 51So when we're talking about electrifying roads, what are we talking about here Evan Milberg 10 55I've seen some some research out of Purdue on this topic. And my impression here is you're essentially putting conduction technology inside the concrete or the asphalt in a way that where you just drive over the road, it can charge the Eevee in real time Sean McMahon 11 17Okay, I gotcha. Yeah, I think I've heard stories about this in the past as well. Yeah, it'sEvan Milberg 11 21not it's not exactly a new technology. But I think what's novel about the study here is the connection to range anxiety. And essentially how you solve that Sean McMahon 11 32Yeah, I'm gonna jump in and just be a pretty skeptical on this little technology, I gotta say, Sure. Is it possible? Yeah. But I'm just not really seeing a place where all the other part of the payment of all the other moving parts have to fall into place for that conduction to work. All right. The vehicles themselves gotta be able to onboard that. And that's just a whole nother thing. I think there are other ways that range anxiety can be addressed, or there's more charging stations, swappable batteries, quite frankly, swappable cars, that stuff just seems more likely, in my mind, and then some of this cool cutting edge road stuff, because then I think we'd also run into other issues with, you know, maintaining these roads, right. road maintenance around the world is a huge thing. How are you gonna take care of this huge motorway that has this technology embedded in it? I don't know Evan Milberg 12 21Well, and I think that's the criticism of a study like this is what's your timeline for implementation? Because this sounds like something that could be mainstream by, say, 2050. But we're dealing with drastically oversized EV batteries now. So what what is your solution right now. And every day, I feel like we're seeing a lot of stories lately about evey charging stations breaking down very easily, and customers being really frustrated with it. And I think improving those charging stations first, maybe with some of that bipartisan infrastructure, a lot of money would go a long way Sean McMahon 12 59Okay, well, thanks, Evan, I think you did a great job pinch hitting for Karen there. And now it's on to the next segment of our show, here and there. Yan usually kind of takes us somewhere around the world or in some technology that is being used to enhance sustainability. So what do you got for us this week, John Jaan van Valkenburgh 13 22Well, this week, we're going to Western Europe, to look at data centers. So there are three ways to make data centers more sustainable. One is to power them with renewable energy, you should put solar panels on the rooftop, we've seen that. Second is to better manage the cloud data. When workloads are high, you consolidate jobs to a few servers, that can save as much as 30% of energy. But it's not for great for performance. You can also throw out some data. Shawn, you and I were talking a little bit about that earlier Sean McMahon 14 00Yeah, there's a really funny story I saw in tech radar, according to the experts, 41% of data that's saved in data centers is not needed. Like companies hang on to this data, and they never go back and access it. And that really hit home for me, because I know that study was about on the corporate side. But I think every single one of us, like every single person listening to this podcast, just looks himself in the mirror and says, How much data do I have saved somewhere that I'm never, ever going to access Jaan van Valkenburgh 14 31Yeah, that kind of hits home Sean McMahon 14 33I tabulate all my emails. I'm bumping my head on 200,000 emails in my inbox, and I think about almost 150,000 Those I've never read. I'm just too lazy to go through and delete them all. And then don't get me started on like, that's on the worksite right, but don't get me started on like my personal stuff like photos and things like that. I have a Google Drive that I've been paying for for, I don't know, 10 years, something like that. And all the vacations I've gone on all the family gatherings I've ever Add. I mean, gosh, I'd like to tell you that I go back and just scroll through all those photos and videos of when the kids were little and things like that. But man, I very rarely do that. And if I do, it's because Google like, throws it at me and says, Oh, 10 years ago, you were doing this, and I see it. So I'm just as guilty of hogging all the space on these data centers, that's never going to be used. And so stories about this, but how to make them more sustainable or more energy efficient? Yes, there's things they can do on the technology front. But it's also the users have a little bit of responsibility to bear here Jaan van Valkenburgh 15 34Yeah, that 41% really hit me as well. And you're right. But I will say that that figure, they were asking the center people, the data center people, they weren't talking to the owners of the data necessarily, or the data analysts, and you don't know where the correlations between different data points are going to be found. So yes, a lot of data is out there. And it's not being used. But we don't want to get rid of it. Because we're scared, we might need it. And the fact is, we need to start finding some creative solutions. So I have questions about that. 41% I gotcha. I think it depends on who you ask. And by the way, all of my photos are incredibly valuable Sean McMahon 16 17All right. But getting back to what's going on in Western Europe, how are some places tackling this problem Jaan van Valkenburgh 16 22Okay, so you power it differently, you manage it differently, or you locate it differently. And that's what's happening in Western Europe. So the goal of finding a different location for the cloud is to reduce the heat signature, or to recycle the facility heat. And basically, recycling is really where it's at in Western Europe. In Stockholm, the city plans to heat in about 12 years from now. 10th of its homes within the data center. Kete. The organization is called Stockholm data parks. It's private data centers that have partnered with the city with the energy company and with the local grid operator. You've got something similar happening in Paris, where a Parisian climate change Arboretum is being heated by a major data center. In Norway, they have 175 acre office slash business park called lease Parkin, where they're building it with infrastructure underground, that will allow tenants to buy shared energy from data centers. And in England, which has very cold winters, as I remember. So the public pools there have to be heated, because you're in England, you just do a little chilly little too chilly or not. Yeah, yeah. When I first read this article, I was like, Why do they have to? Why would you need a oh, wait a second. England? Yeah, it needs to be heated. Yeah, I would never go into a no, absolutely not. So the public cools, we're going to have to close because of heating costs. And what they found was that they could solve this problem by putting the data centers under the public pools. Everybody wins. Similar thing is happening in Switzerland. So it's just something to consider Sean McMahon 18 17Yeah, I guess you can count me among the people who never thought a datacenter would play a role in keeping public pools open. But a it's a big and wild world out there, I guess. And speaking of the big world out there. Now it's time for our interview with Jill Blickstein, the Vice President of Sustainability at American Airlines. But before we get started, I want to point out that while we're all missing care in this episode, you still get to hear from another smartbrief content expert. That expert is my esteemed colleague, Angie Giroux, and she covers the aviation industry for SmartBrief, so I invited her to join me and Jill for our conversation. I hope you enjoy it. Hello, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. My colleague, Angie Giroux and I are pleased to be joined by Jill Blickstein from American Airlines. Jill, how you doing today Jill Blickstein 19 08Great. How are you doing today Sean McMahon 19 10Great, great. We're here to talk about everything that American Airlines is doing in the world of sustainability. So let's start right from the top. When people think of American Airlines, they think of these big beautiful jets zooming around the sky. And so you know, when you take a fleet wide view on everything your organization's doing, what are some of the steps that American Airlines has taken to become more sustainable Jill Blickstein 19 27So sustainability is a pretty big challenge for aviation. And that means all airlines, particularly big airlines, and American is one of the largest airlines in 2019. Before COVID, we used about four and a half billion gallons of fuel and we emitted about 40 million tons of co2. And so while we're flying some of the more efficient airplanes like the Boeing max and the Airbus 321 Neo, we've been through a big fleet renewal project over the last couple of years. You know, we still burn fossil based jet fuel. And so there's a huge effort going on in our industry and working with fuel producers and governments and others to try to find a replacement or renewable version of that fuel. And so that's something I'm hoping we're going to talk more about today Sean McMahon 20 10Yeah, let's get right into that. I think you're alluding to sustainable aviation fuel, commonly referred to as SAF. So for listeners who might not be familiar with Saf, what is it? How are these fuels created? And just walk us through the basics Jill Blickstein 20 23Absolutely. So the sap that we're using today, we're burning a tiny, tiny bit, I call it about a teaspoon, we're burning a tiny bit of sap today. The stuff that we're buying is made by a company called Nesta based in Finland. And the idea is that you can take waste fats and oils and refine them into a fuel. And when you combine that fuel that renewable fuel with fossil jet fuel at no more than 50% SAF to petroleum jet fuel, and commonly it's blended more like 35 or 30%, the resulting fuel is equivalent to Jet A. And I know a lot of times when I say that people kind of Blink and look at me, like how could that be real, but there's an international standard setting body that actually approves jet fuel, and they approve the technical specifications of jet fuel. And so they've approved with this this fuel made from waste oils and fats is called Heba fuel. It stands for hydro process esters and fatty acids Sean McMahon 21 20That sounds like a whole lot going on there. Okay,Jill Blickstein 21 23that sounds like it sounds a lot like a little too close to food, right. So the nasty fuel that we're buying today is actually made from beef tallow, which is be fat, you know, we blend it and we take it in by ship to the Port of San Francisco. And it goes into the pipeline there, and it's delivered to the airport. So that's the kind of fuel is being made today. And again, it has that blend limit. What's what's amazing about that fuel, is that it can is a drop in fuel. And by that I mean it is dropped into the common tanks and airports, a lot of people don't know, like all the airlines share at big airports, we all share these common tanks, so our fuel goes in. And then obviously, it's mixed with all the other fuel and then it's it's used by every airline, that right, we get credit for the emissions reduction, because we're using it. But think about that, like it's made from beef towel, it goes into the common tanks, and then every airline can fly on it, every aircraft today can fly on it right, we're not making changes to the fueling system, we're not making changes to the aircraft for it. And if you've flown out of San Francisco or LA in the last five years, you've probably flown on a little bit of stuff Sean McMahon 22 25And I understand it's one of the most important things in terms of it being able to be used with any existing infrastructure and existing planes, things like that. Because otherwise, you run into supply issues in which airports are going to have this special kind of feeling which ones aren't. So having it be more of a blend, I guess we'll call it is is crucial, right Jill Blickstein 22 41It's crucial, because we've already put billions of dollars in investments into the fueling system into the pipelines into the tanks, right. And we can't recreate that for a new kind of fuel. So sometimes people will say, Well, you know, I want to, I want to buy SAP and I want it I want this app to go on my plane, I want this app to go into like my route. That's not how it works, right, it's going into common tanks, a little bit is going on to every plane. And that's why we use what's called a bucket claim system. So you know, American bought the fuel or whatever airline bought the fuel, it went into the common tank. So we we get to claim the the environmental benefit of that fuel, but it is going into every we typically don't fuel planes individually. Usually they're their fuel from a common system. And the bottom line on SAF is that on a lifecycle basis, SAF has 75% lower greenhouse gas emissions than petroleum jet fuel 75%. In an industry where we can on a tip on a good year, reduce our emissions by one or half two, or 2% 75% is a very big number. And I would say that as we get better at making staff and as we use newer, more efficient pathways, that number is going to go up. In fact, we expect that eventually we have staff that is reducing our emissions by 90 to 95% Angie Giroux 23 56You've added a lot of clarity there. Thanks for explaining that. smartbrief has included stories in our aviation newsletters about how American Airlines is looking to have 10% of fuel BSA f by 2030. Can you update us on American's progress on reaching that goal Jill Blickstein 24 15Absolutely. So roughly speaking, if we're burning about 5 billion gallons of jet fuel in 2030, our goal is about 500 million gallons of, of SAF by then and let me just put that in context a little bit for you. So last year, we probably burned more staff than any other airline. I don't have definitive figures on this yet, but it's about 2 million gallons, you know, in a year where we probably use three and a half to 4 billion gallons of jet fuel. So it really is a tiny amount. And there's very little staff available in the marketplace today. Now that's going to change, right? We're learning about new production facilities coming online. We're helping to get some of those facilities built as lots of airlines are looking to Do this. And the new provisions of the inflation Reduction Act there is a special blenders tax credit for the very first time. So that's drawing new production and interest in investment into the United States and South. We have two contracts one with a company called a meet us and another with a new company, a company called GMO, who make all kinds of renewable chemicals and fuels and are starting to get into the Saft business. So we have definitive agreements to purchase about 220 million gallons of sap in 2030. And so we're about to a little more than 20% of the way towards our goal in 2030. What's interesting about that is when we go to sign contract, there's two things I want to mention when when we go to sign contracts for staff, one of the things that's really different is we're signing contracts with companies who haven't built their plants yet. And just think about how different that is from how we normally fuel right, we're normally buying fuel from the oil majors fuel. Jet fuel is a super commodity, incredibly liquid, we trade with airlines, we trade with airports like it's, it's a very well oiled machine, right, no pun intended. Whereas now we're buying stuff from people who haven't made jet fuel yet. So it's just a very uncertain kind of endeavor. And of course, all the stuff in the world, most of the stuff in the world is being delivered into California, because California has a financial incentive. So it's cheaper to deliver stuff into California. Well, at some point, we're all going to run out of California capacity. That will be I think that will be a high quality problem. I'm excited forSean McMahon 26 22that day. Okay, now, you mentioned California a couple of times now, and you know, flights out of LA or San Francisco, or you're probably using Southfield for that, or sorry, I guess if fuel is redundant, isn't it? Sorry. Anyway, so I want to ask you a question. I do a lot of stories on the finance side, and a lot of companies are trying to, you know, the SEC is going to be coming out with some disclosure rules, right? Where companies need to track their mission, scope one, scope two, scope three. And I know you already mentioned that, like some people, you put a little bit in every plane, so you can't really ask for a route that has the most staff. But do you see a future where that might be the case, particularly for routes that are maybe more relying on business travelers? Or if I'm Google, and I'm flying a bunch of people up and down from LA to San Francisco and back, you know, or wherever, maybe on the East Coast, it's going to be New York to DC or New York to Philly or somewhere like that? Do you see a future where that segment of passengers will want to make sure that their executives are there people are flying on planes, where they can then track Hey, we're, we're using an airline American is offering more staff than any other competitors. So we're going on American because American allows us to check that box or report that part for the SEC, is that something that's just too pie in the sky? Am I just dreaming? Or is that something you think might become a reality, I thinkJill Blickstein 27 33that's gonna become a reality. So I share that dream with you. It will not be that South is on my plane. But it will be the case that you if you're a big company, or that wants to reduce your emissions from your employees traveling, you will be able to come to me and by the emissions reduction value of staff. And I say it that way. Because if you're a company Company X, and you want to be able to reduce your emissions, you don't want to buy fuel from me, right? You want to get the credit from having flown on staff. And when I say flown, I mean that as an image not as an as a reality. Right? So if American has bought 2 million gallons of sap, let's say or is using 2 million gallons of sap, you can then buy the image emission reduction value of that. And that's because of how the scopes work. Right. So let's just take one minute to talk about scope one and scope three, right? Scope. One are the direct emissions. When I American Airlines, USAF, I take the scope one emissions reduction, because it's made from renewable source. But I have also incurred a scope three emission for the business travelers who traveled with us. So American burning jet fuel is not your direct emission, it's your indirect emission, it's your upstream or downstream. I get confused which one it is. So I can still take the scope one emission reduction for SAP and you can take the scope three at the same time. That's double counting. But that double counting is built into carbon accounting. carbon accounting was meant to have this because the people who created it wanted me the airline to have an incentive to reduce my emissions. And they wanted you my customer to talk to me about reducing my emissions. Does that make sense Sean McMahon 29 14Yeah, absolutely. That's the symbiotic relationship. I hate using that word. Because I seem I feel so cheesy, but it's a symbiotic relationship that the policymakers are trying to generate, right Jill Blickstein 29 23Yes, they want you to pressure your supply chain. And they want me to pressure my supply chain too. So I'm now talking to my jet fuel producers about how they can reduce their emissions in the production of jet fuel. So we're all supposed to be pressuring all of our supply chains. And in that way, we really will get more serious emissions reductions Sean McMahon 29 41So that takes you back to what you're saying earlier about house. You're exploring relationships with manufacturers, you haven't even built the plant yet. So now you can have some insight or input on how they create that plant and build it and operate it right. Yes Jill Blickstein 29 53And I'm also having conversations with my customers, you know, we've sold, we've done exactly what you've been talking about. We have actually sold the emission reduction To the value of sustainable aviation fuel to a set of corporate customers who themselves have, for example, science based targets, they really need to reduce their scope three. And a company like Deloitte, for example. They don't have a lot of direct emissions, they have a lot of scope three, because they travel a lot. And so we actually approached them and said, we want to test out this new, this new way of transacting with Saf, right? Because eventually we want to do is create a SAS certificate. That's the end goal, so that you as even if you're a leisure traveler, you're going on vacation with your family, but you want to offset your emissions, maybe you could buy a carbon offset, or maybe you want to buy, you want something that's actually in the airline business, you actually want to buy the emission reduction value of staff, you one day, you will be able to go buy a staff certificate. Wow Sean McMahon 30 45It's incredible even just to take the family on vacation Angie Giroux 30 47Yes, it's good stuff. Seems like there's a lot of great opportunities going on for staff. We've been hearing about zero Abia and other ways American Airlines is investing across the industry to reduce his carbon impact. Can you tell us a little bit more about those efforts Jill Blickstein 31 03Absolutely. So we have a goal to reach net zero emissions by 2050. And we do have a science based target approved for 2035 as well. So we have to reduce our emissions very significantly, at least by 2035. And obviously thereafter, if we're going to meet the goals of the Paris agreement, we have a plan that we've laid out for how we're going to do that, which relies a lot on SAF and on new modes of propulsion, and on having the newest aircraft and engines. So new propulsion, we've invested in two companies, one is their Avia, and another is universal hydrogen, both of whom are working on hydrogen propulsion for aircraft. Now, hydrogen propulsion is not new, the military flew on hydrogen in the 1950s, I think. But the modern version of it using fuel cells is really in its infancy. And I will say, you know, I've been doing this role for about three years. And in that three years, I've seen a huge amount of acceleration, right, we got the soft tax credit, we're seeing a lot more soft production, we're seeing hydrogen has gone from something that people said was impossible. Now, both those companies have done have performed test flights using a hydrogen fuel cell actually burning hydrogen, and to make electricity to power the rotors. So zero Avia wants to create first very small regional planes. And you know, obviously start small so that we can go to something bigger, and universal hydrogen did a test flight, they are going to do a retrofit for small regional planes at the beginning, although these are more like I think, 40 to 50 seater. So that's a decent sized plane. And then what they what they want to focus on is the hydrogen, the logistics of hydrogen fuel delivery to airports. So this was something we talked about at the beginning. You know, SAP is great, because you don't have to create a whole new logistics system. The idea, we also probably can't create a whole new hydrogen logistics, infrastructure. But what they're what universal hydrogen is doing is creating capsules that can contain the hydrogen that can be moved by truck easily from airport to airport or among airports. And that can be loaded pretty easily onto the plane. So you're not talking about creating a whole new fueling system. And so American Airlines is investing in both sides, I call it of the hydrogen, what will become the new hydrogen ecosystem, right? It's having a new hydrogen propelled plane. And it's having a way to deliver the fuel that is low emission and efficient Sean McMahon 33 24Okay. And speaking of other initiatives, or other, you know, efforts that American's making, I saw you got y'all are interacting with the Bill Gates led Breakthrough Energy ventures, what's that relationship look like? And how did it get started Jill Blickstein 33 35So we are a anchor partner of Breakthrough Energy catalysts. So Breakthrough Energy has a bunch of different companies in it. One of them is Breakthrough Energy ventures, which is obviously doing venture investing catalysts. The goal of catalyst is to provide low cost capital, to companies and projects that are positioned to scale. So it's not super early investing. It's investing in technologies that work in the lab. And that and we're these companies need extra capital, we need capital to build to actually get to scale. So it's very kind of purposeful, we've been looking around for a strategic partner on sustainability. Because, well, obviously, airlines don't make fuel right? We don't make airplanes we go to OEMs. And we ask them to make us airplanes and engines and all these other things, right? We don't make we don't make all the stuff we eat fly the airplane. So we're not. I wouldn't call us like the experts in making any of those things. And so we were looking for a partner who shared our goals, but could help us make the smart choices about where to invest. So we have 100 million commitment to Breakthrough Energy catalyst. Catalyst has already made an investment in Lonzo jet, which is a staff producer in the United States. It's going to make alcoholic jet staff meaning they're going to make staff using ethanol, and they needed the catalyst financing to build their test plant. So it's only the test plant is gonna make about 10 million gallons a year I think, but once they get the technology right and the test plant, then they can go build bigger plants and that is sort of A great test case for how we want catalysts work Sean McMahon 35 02Well, that sounds great. I'd love to get an update from you down the road about other kinds of smaller ventures that are getting bigger through the catalysts. So we'll try to follow up with you on that Angie Giroux 35 10Jill, can you talk a little bit about American's plan to transition aircraft from steel to carbon fiber breaks Jill Blickstein 35 17Yeah, so this is interesting, you know, the most brakes on planes are made from steel, which is pretty heavy. And the military actually pioneered the use of carbon brakes. Because they were lighter, they could absorb more energy, and they lasted longer, they were also more expensive. Now, I think because of innovations in technology, that price has come down somewhat, but also because they're lighter. And they last longer, right, there's a return on investment there. So we have recently begun a plan to purchase carbon brakes from saffron for our 737 fleet. And we're going to save lots of fuel and lots of emissions. And that's one of the things we can do in our operation, right? And we're looking at things like that we probably have a list of 20 or 30 Different things that we're we're always in in the mode of pricing out when can we get a return on the investment in these things? How will they help our operation? Where can we save on maintenance? You know, one thing that we did in the last couple of years, we invested in a new application, you know, the pilots now instead of having to have these big books of directions and instructions, they now get lots of the information they need to operate the flight on their iPad, right? That's the new flight bag is the iPad, and through the Wi Fi on the plane, we're delivering real time weather information to pilots. So they're constantly are able to check on an ongoing basis. Has the weather changed? Are we seeing a storm are we seeing turbulence and turbulence obviously, is a critical safety issue, but also very important to fuel burn. And so pilots now see a very clear screen that shows them where where turbulence is and shows them how to change their route and usually a slight change in altitude to avoid an area of turbulence. And we have saved millions and millions of gallons of jet fuel by giving pilots this new tool in the cockpit Sean McMahon 37 02Again, it sounds like something that passengers might not really realize is happening in the cockpit, but it is enhancing their travel experience Jill Blickstein 37 08Exactly, exactly. I mean, just like the lighter paint, you know, we're putting lighter pain that lasts longer on our aircraft, passengers aren't going to really see that or recognize the value of that. But it also saves fuel. I mean, that's, you know, the technologies that we started talking, you started out talking about the staff and the and the new propulsion, those are going to come really upscale, it's going to take probably a decade for those to really come on sale. So what we're doing, we're doing everything we can in our operation today to save fuel. In the end, it's going to save us, you know, one to 2% I'd say of jet fuel of our of our jet fuel on our emissions, whereas SAF and new propulsion, the new propulsion, if we can grow the industry for green hydrogen, that could be zero emission flying Sean McMahon 37 51Yeah. And he said the prospect or the potential that zero emission flight is even, you know, even more breathtaking, I guess you'd say, it's even better. It just occurred to me, a lot of the things we're talking about right now are things that passengers might not notice. Right. You mentioned, like, you know, you might not even know if your plane is, you know, powered by staff or percentage of staff, and some of these other things that are going on behind the scenes. But what are some of the things just from a sustainability perspective, or, you know, conserving fuel or just reducing carbon emissions? What are some of the things that American's working on that passengers might see or might benefit from directly, and it's really kind of putting it in front of them rather than behind the scenes Jill Blickstein 38 25You know, you're absolutely right, that customers don't see the most important things that we're doing to reduce our impact on the planet. And so everything from the fuel, I mean, obviously, they'll see it when they're boarding a whole new kind of aircraft, for example. But there's a lot of other things we do in our operations that have a big impact. And I'd love to talk about those in a bit as well. What they do see are the plastic cups and the plastic cutlery and the plastic wrap on their food and all of that and we are working to reduce that. I say that with some hesitancy because I think during we had a lot of plants before COVID. And COVID just took everyone you know, we weren't allowed to hand the can of coke to the passenger anymore, right in COVID. So it really put a stop to a lot of the things we were trying to do. Lots of those things have been reintroduced. We are recycling more, we've picked up the recycling. We've replaced plastic cutlery with bamboo cutlery and lots of lights. Before COVID We got rid of the plastic stirring sticks and the straws. Of course, we're an airline. So we couldn't get rid of all the straws. I think we still have one or two straws for people who need them. But we were able to get rid of most of the straws. And we're very big. So when we go to replace something, we have to have a supply chain that can really deliver that product to us. And so yes, we're making we're making progress and our customers should should be seeing on their flights, lots of new products that might look a little bit different than the products that we're used to seeing Sean McMahon 39 47So I was on your website doing a little bit of research ahead of this and I did see something that caught my eye and it's called Smart Gating. And I think every traveler can relate to the feeling of you know, you've landed at your destination, your taxi Then over to the concourse. But then the pilot comes on and says, Oh, well, we got to sit on the tarmac because we don't have any gates to park at right now. So it sounds like American's working on smart gating is something that American's working on to try to fix that. Can you describe what smart gating is for our listeners Jill Blickstein 40 17Yes, absolutely. So assigning planes to gates was a manual process. And it took four hours, this is my favorite part, it took four hours every night between 10pm and 2am, that the dispatch team had to sit down and like map out where every plane was going to gate. And then as soon as something went wrong, they had to fix it completely fixed the plan, right, because it all every flight cascades to the next slide, what we did was we used, we built internally, a machine learning application that sits on top of the existing application and takes that four hours down to basically like two and a half minutes that it takes to actually assign. And of course, you know, the teams went out to every airport to learn all the intricacies of what you want to do is, you know, lay in the plane, probably at the gate that is well positioned for the next flight, right. So that's also saving you saving you time and money. In the end, what it's done, we've deployed it at DFW and at Dallas Fort Worth, and at the Charlotte airport, which are two of our biggest hubs in the United States. And it's already saved us a million gallons of fuel by reducing taxi time by about two minutes. So those two minutes that you're sitting there wondering, if you're like driving into the next state, that ride is gonna feel shorter, and it's gonna burn less fuel, and it's gonna save a lot of emissions Sean McMahon 41 23You said, it's a machine learning tool, and we live in a world where it seems like AI is a bad word these days. But are you suggesting, Jill that there's AI being put to good use, is that what you're trying to tell us Jill Blickstein 41 31That's exactly what I'm trying to tell you. There are lots of very complex operations at an airport. If you ever get a chance to get a view of what airport operations look like our COO showed us one of those fast action films where they speed up all the action, you can see what it really takes to get an airplane off the ground. It's multiple teams working on multiple in sequence, right. And so much has to happen. And so much has to happen in the right sequence and fast for us to turn an aircraft and so anything we can do like like smart gating, where we're using these new tools, you know, the all those people who were spending four hours trying to assign planes to gates, think what they can do now, with that time, and that freed up brain power. So it's pretty exciting Angie Giroux 42 13I think it's fascinating technology I'm picking it really does, you know, enable a smoother travel experience for passengers. Okay, ISean McMahon 42 20was looking at your website, when in terms of you know, operations that are powered by renewables. There's something in there about how your your corporate headquarters, I think at DFW is 100% renewable Jill Blickstein 42 29Yes, we are purchasing renewable energy certificates to offset all of our electricity use in our North Texas facility. So that includes our headquarters and our integrated operating center, and our training facilities, and obviously the airport as well. And we're talking to all of our airports about how we can work together to reduce fuel use to reduce electricity use electricity, the emissions from purchase electricity are less than 1% of our total emissions. So because we burn so much jet fuel jet fuel is really the focus of our work, but we haven't lost sight of the need to also reduce our electricity use Sean McMahon 43 02Now, I want to circle back to something you mentioned earlier about how American you know has its carbon emissions targets validated by the science based targets initiative. Can you explain to our listeners what that is and how that process took place Jill Blickstein 43 13So the science based targets Initiative is a set of environmental nonprofits, I think its World Wildlife Foundation CDP World Resources Institute, they saw that lots of companies were trying to set netzero goals and emissions reduction goals. And they also saw that investors and customers were struggling to understand how one company's goals compared to another company's goals. And if those goals had any science behind them, me now we have the Paris Agreement. Now we have the IPCC reports telling us what we really need to do to reduce emissions to meet the goals of the Paris agreement to essentially arrest global warming. So what they did was they came up with this rubric they call science based targets. So for example, they will tell companies, they have they published a pathway. So companies needed to be able to route that reduce their emissions on a certain path, to be able to get to zero by 2050. And they call that so that's a ScienceBase. Target for for 2050. And they said to companies, okay, you want to publish a pathway or a target and you want our blessing. You submit your target to us, and we will review it, and we'll tell you if it meets our criteria. And what I've read is that they thought nobody was going to want to do this. And it turned out that hundreds and hundreds of companies wanted to do this, because companies face the same problem, right? They wanted to set a emissions reduction goal, they want to show that they're taking climate change seriously. And they needed external validation. And so the whole idea of the science based target initiative, I think, kind of exceeded the expectations of the people who set it up. So they they have been growing the initiative and for a long time, airlines could not even apply because all the emissions reductions targets from sbti. They were all absolute. So they said you have to get Your emissions absolutely down by whatever percent by let's say 2035. They realized that it wasn't appropriate for every industry. Because as we grow, our emissions are going to grow. And because we don't have near term ways to really cut our emissions significantly, right, because we don't have satphone. We don't have new propulsion yet. Just realSean McMahon 45 20quick, just to explain to listeners, so some industries have ready made solutions that are or at least really close to being ready. Other industries, whether it's airlines or shipping or whatever, little farther away,Jill Blickstein 45 31yeah, airlines and shipping are called hard to abate. Very hard to evade, not really the moniker you want to have. Whereas think about like road transport is decarbonizing today with electric trucking can decarbonize by using renewable diesel, which is made from the same feedstocks, the same inputs that SAP is made from, I like to say I'm a little jealous of road transport, although the bonus is that as road transport decarbonize, it's going to free up that ethanol production. And maybe we can, we're on a path to be able to reuse that ethanol to make stuff. So that's pretty exciting. So going back to the sinespace, target for a minute. So what they would what they did was they realized they had to create unique pathways for these hard to evade industries. So I think oil and gas has what aviation we have our own pathway, it's a reduction in carbon intensity. So think about it as emissions per seat, for example. And we have to reduce our emissions essentially proceed by about 45% by 2035. So it's far away. It's a drastic cut. But that's we expect SAF to be really scaling by 2030. And we expect to have be able to take advantage of cost competitive stuff in the 2030s. And we expect hydrogen propulsion to be well on its way by that as well Sean McMahon 46 45Wow, that would be incredible. That's for sure. All right. Well, hey, Jill, listen, this has been a fascinating conversation. Thank you so much for your time. We really appreciate it Jill Blickstein ""]",0.7277558

So what are the best airlines to fly? The personal-finance website WalletHub has just announced its annual list of the best U.S. airlines. In addition to comparing the nine largest national airlines in the United States and two regional carriers, WalletHub also revealed the most reliable airline, the most comfortable airline, the most affordable airline, the best airline for pets and the safest airline. WalletHub came up with the list by collecting and analyzing flight data from the U.S. Department of Transportation and using a strategic methodology that compared 14 key metrics ranging from cancellation and delay rates to baggage mishaps and in-flight comfort. The analysis also considered costs in relation to in-flight amenities. ""WalletHub\'s analysis is a comprehensive one, based on a methodology and metrics selected by our analysts along with academic experts. Our goal was to go beyond price comparison tools and identify the best airlines in terms of overall service quality and functional performance,"" says Wallethub analyst Jill Gonzalez. ""While price is of course essential, finding the most affordable airline is extremely easy. WalletHub\'s report goes a step further and examines other aspects of flying that sometimes go overlooked, to help consumers make more informed decisions."" What are the best airlines in 2023?

As a part of this project, the airline is looking to modernize the lobby experience and as the company announced today, the most visible change here will be the removal of the good old check-in kiosk Alaska will encourage fliers to check in at home or on their smartphones and instead of the kiosks, the airline will introduce single-function, iPad-based bag tag stations, where fliers can scan their boarding passes to get a bag tag, and automatic bag drops. These bag drops will also mark the first time Alaska will use biometric data to authenticate travelers The airline started testing this system at a number of airports, including Palm Springs, in recent months, but it's now announcing this wider rollout Image Credits Alaska AirlinesCharu Jain, Alaska's senior VP of merchandising and innovation, stressed that Alaska was the first airline to put kiosks in the airport lobby and that it now wants to be the first to remove them. The airline, she said, is always looking for ways to remove pain points and the lobby experience remains one of those, as travelers simply want to get through security and to their gate. When we looked at what to do with that pain point, we started reimagining the lobby and looking at customer behavior and trends, Jain said. Everybody uses their mobile phone now. So we're really kind of saying 'goodbye to kiosks and hello smartphone' and what that does is it creates a very easy way to connect and get through the lobby in five minutes or less. Image Credits Alaska AirlinesShe noted that today, across all of the airports that Alaska serves, about 70% of travelers check in before they arrive at the airport (and in some places, that number is significantly higher). The company wants to drive that number to 90%. The idea to get every flier through the lobby is five minutes is also ambitious. However, Jain argues that today, users have to enter their confirmation number in the kiosk and then maybe pay for baggage and also select seats -- and then wait for the machine to print a boarding pass -- all of which can take over five minutes. Now, at some of the stations that the company has started using this system, fliers take around 45 seconds to print a bag tag Image Credits Alaska AirlinesIt's interesting that Alaska decided to go with a consumer-level iPad connected to a printer for the bag tagging experience, but Jain argues that this allows the company to quickly iterate on the experience. She noted that Alaska worked closely with Apple on this project. Alaska also already provides all of its agents with iOS devices. What this does is it creates this iOS ecosystem where all that technology can talk to each other now, she explained. So we're connecting the agents not just physically but also through technology with our guests. And a lot of our guests have Apple phones versus Android, too. It's easy to change, too. Any change on the kiosk, you'd have to work with a vendor and that takes about six weeks. With these, we can roll out changes very quickly and it's a very simple and good user experience. Image Credits Alaska AirlinesThe new automated bag drops will launch later, but once they become available, they'll look quite similar to Delta's new biometrics-based bag drops and just like with Delta's system, Alaska will also work with the TSA to enable biometric confirmation that it was really you who dropped off a bag (though you will also be able to scan your ID or work with an agent) It's worth noting that Alaska is obviously aware that not everybody will be able to check in online. gents will remain available for assistance, and Jain emphasized that travelers will continue to have this option.

The Southwest Airlines holiday seasons meltdown directed a lot more attention to all U.S. airlines. Nobody saw Southwest\'s issues coming, so it\'s reasonable to question whether another major airline has a potential glitch that could disrupt its operations. And it also makes sense to be proactive when it comes to heading off potential problems. That\'s something the Federal Aviation Administration has been aggressive about in New York, one of the nation\'s busiest airport markets.

""The FAA is taking several steps to keep air travel to and from New York City this summer safe and smooth, even as we see strong domestic demand and a return of prepandemic international traffic,"" the agency said in a news release. ""To help prevent disruptions, the agency will give airlines flexibility on slot usage requirements. In turn, the FAA expects airlines to take actions minimizing impacts on passengers, including operating larger aircraft to transport more passengers and making sure passengers are fully informed about any possible disruptions."" Basically, the federal agency has given the airlines more flexibility around their allotted slots at airports in exchange for a cut in overall flights leaving from the three airports. Major New York Flight Cuts This Summer The FAA moves, which also affect Reagan Washington National Airport in Washington, were made due to shortages of aircraft controllers. Newark Airport, while it does serve the New York market, is not part of the summer changes. To meet the FAA\'s requirements, a number of airlines have slashed their flights out of New York and Washington, Travel Weekly reported American Airlines Cut 4,790 flights to or from JFK, LaGuardia and Reagan National, as well as Newark Liberty International Airport, from its May 1 to Sept. 30 schedule. United Airlines Cut 4,353 flights between New York and Washington. JetBlue Cut 3,565 flights at the affected airports. Delta Cut 1,983 flights between New York and Washington. Southwest Airlines (LUV) – Get Free Report has not made any cuts to its schedule, but it could cut some flights later. Essentially, the FAA change enables the airlines not to use all their available slots. That lets them cut flights –after filing a request with the FAA for a waiver — which should lead to packed planes at higher prices. These changes have afffected flights that passengers had already booked.

To maintain safety and meet demand, the agency later this year will reassign the approximately 100 square miles of Newark airspace from N90 to the Philadelphia Terminal Radar Approach Control. "", ""At the FAA's request, pretty much every major airline has made a change that many fliers will be unhappy about The Southwest Airlines holiday seasons meltdown directed a lot more attention to all U.S. airlines. Nobody saw Southwest's issues coming, so it's reasonable to question whether another major airline has a potential glitch that could disrupt its operations And it also makes sense to be proactive when it comes to heading off potential problems. That's something the Federal Aviation Administration has been aggressive about in New York, one of the nation's busiest airport markets DON'T MISS American Airlines Makes a Very Unpopular Pricing ChangeWhat happens at New York's City's three nearby airports, JFK, LaGuardia, and Newark, affects not only people flying in and out of the New York area, It has a ripple effect on air travel around the country. That's at least partly why the FAA has gotten involved. The FAA is taking several steps to keep air travel to and from New York City this summer safe and smooth, even as we see strong domestic demand and a return of prepandemic international traffic, the agency said in a news release. To help prevent disruptions, the agency will give airlines flexibility on slot usage requirements. In turn, the FAA expects airlines to take actions minimizing impacts on passengers, including operating larger aircraft to transport more passengers and making sure passengers are fully informed about any possible disruptions. Basically, the federal agency has given the airlines more flexibility around their allotted slots at airports in exchange for a cut in overall flights leaving from the three airports.

Image source Shutterstock Major New York Flight Cuts This SummerThe FAA moves, which also affect Reagan Washington National Airport in Washington, were made due to shortages of aircraft controllers. Newark Airport, while it does serve the New York market, is not part of the summer changes To meet the FAA's requirements, a number of airlines have slashed their flights out of New York and Washington, Travel Weekly reported American Airlines Cut 4,790 flights to or from JFK, LaGuardia and Reagan National, as well as Newark Liberty International Airport, from its May 1 to Sept. 30 schedule United Airlines Cut 4,353 flights between New York and Washington. JetBlue Cut 3,565 flights at the affected airports. Delta Cut 1,983 flights between New York and Washington Southwest Airlines (LUV) - Get Free Report has not made any cuts to its schedule, but it could cut some flights later Essentially, the FAA change enables the airlines not to use all their available slots. That lets them cut flights --after filing a request with the FAA for a waiver -- which should lead to packed planes at higher prices. These changes have afffected flights that passengers had already booked. In response to the FAA's slot waiver, American will temporarily reduce frequencies on select routes from LaGuardia and Newark Liberty International Airport this summer, according to an AA statement, Travel Weekly shared. We're proactively reaching out to affected customers to offer alternate travel arrangements. The FAA Has an Air Traffic Controller Problem These changes are needed because the U.S. has a shortage of air-traffic controllers. The federal agency is taking steps to fix those issues in the long term The FAA held a New York airspace summit with airlines and others to discuss additional ways to improve the country's most complex and congested airspace in late March. It was similar to the one hosted in Florida last year that resulted in measures to improve efficiency in another high-demand area, the agency shared That's not the only step the FAA has taken. Although the FAA continues to reduce the air traffic controller training backlog at many FAA air traffic facilities, staffing levels at the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control (N90) continue to be below targets, the FAA said in a news release.

In the viral video, which was posted in mid-March, the unidentified Spirit employee informed passengers on board a flight from Dallas, Texas, to Los Angeles, that they would be charged for every single thing they\'d need during their journey, including blankets and earplugs. ""No, we do not have sockets for you to plug up your phones, because if we did, we will charge you,"" the hilarious flight attendant said as passengers chuckled. ""No, we do not have blankets for you, because if we did, this is Spirit, and we will charge you,"" the Spirit employee continued, before she joked about the airline\'s janky chairs. ""No, your seats do not recline. If they did, again, this is Spirit, and we will charge you."" Then, the unbothered crew member quipped, ""And no, we do not have earplugs for you because if we did, y\'all know this is Spirit, and we will do what?"" ""Charge you!"" a passenger responded. Towards the end of her funny rant, the Spirit employee told travelers that she wished she could provide them with what they needed to make their flight comfortable, but due to company policy, she couldn\'t. The flight attendant finished up her schpiel by telling passengers that the airline would only accept Apple or Google Pay, not cash. ""One way or another we just want you to pay,"" she joked. On TikTok, users applauded the Spirit employee for her hilarious honesty. ""Protect this woman,"" wrote one user. ""She needs a promotion immediately,"" said another. A third TikTok user joked, ""This is quiet quitting, lol."" What are Spirit Airlines\' policies? Travelers usually opt to fly with Spirit due to their cheap prices for airfare. However, by the time passengers pay for bags, assigned seats, snacks and other ""amenities,"" they easily rack up a triple-digit bill. Basic fares usually include one personal item, like a laptop bag or purse. But it has to be smaller than 18″x14″x8″, the airline\'s website states. If you need to travel with bigger luggage and multiple bags, expect to pay anywhere between 26 to 65. These numbers can fluctuate depending on whether you book online or at the airport, according to NerdWallet. If seating isn\'t a big deal, you can opt to have Spirit assign your seating arrangements for you, but if you have special accommodations, you might have to cough up anywhere between 1 to 250 for seating. Need to cancel your travel plans? Spirit will make you pay for that, too. The low-budget airline charges customers 90 to cancel their reservation online and 100 to cancel over the phone. But there are a few tricks to get around the company\'s dusty policies. Listen to what this flight attendant had to say below in the viral video.

The unidentified man had supposedly requested the cocktail but was denied it by officers prompting a row that caused staff to call the police. Social media were quick to slam the 'man-child' who was later filmed sobbing as he was arrested on the jet bridge of the American Airlines flight. The clip begins with the man being ordered to leave by officers – to which he refuses. Fellow passengers can be heard begging the man to exit the aircraft but he continues to remain seated as he argues with officers. At one point he takes out his phone to record the altercation but it is promptly removed from his hand. Officers then yank him from his seat and wrangle with him in the aisle. The man repeatedly yells out 'stop' before bursting into tears. After finally vacating the plane he continues to wail as he falls to the floor and is pinned down by officers who handcuffed him. It is not clear why he was refused the gin and tonic or how the situation escalated. American Airlines rules state that first-class passengers are entitled to a drink before take-off. The man reportedly complained that he was not guilty of a crime. However, the US Department of Transportation says airlines can remove any passenger for reasons relating to 'safety, security or health risk, or due to a behavior that is considered obscene, disruptive or otherwise unlawful.' The video was posted to TikTok and shared on Reddit where it garnered over 4,000 comments. 'I did not expect him to start weeping like that! What a man child!' one wrote. Another said 'When his shoe came off, it reminded me of my 5-year-old nephew when he doesn't want to take a nap but is clearly tired.' It comes after a spate of bad behavior on US flights. Last month, shocking video footage captured the moment a father attacked a passenger unprovoked in front of his children during a Southwest Airlines flight. The violent confrontation saw the man put another in a headlock as others on board were forced to intervene yelling 'Do not hit him again.' Meanwhile, a flight from LA to Boston this week made headlines after a passenger threatened to 'kill every man on this plane.' Francisco Severo Torres, 33, from Leominster, Massachusetts was charged with one count of interference and attempted interference with flight crew members using a dangerous weapon after he stabbed a flight attendant with a broken spoon. In a video shot by a fellow passenger sitting only feet away, Torres can be heard threatening to commit mass murder while goading others to try and stop him. Dailymail.com has reached out to American Airlines for comment. //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11952393/First-class-American-Airlines-passenger-TANTRUM-like-5-year-old-hes-refused-drink.html About Post Author Continue Reading "", 'A video of an American Airlines first-class passenger recently went viral on the internet showing an unidentified man being handcuffed and dragged off a flight following his request for an alcoholic drink – a gin and tonic cocktail – resulting in the man\'s tearful meltdown. The video has now garnered a wide range of reactions, with people criticizing the passenger\'s ""shameful"" behavior and wondering what went down below to warrant such a reaction. In a 5-minute, 27-second clip uploaded to TikTok, and also released on Reddit and Twitter, the passenger can be seen arguing with airport authorities, who were asking the man to exit the plane, while he sat in his seat. . It is being reported that the pilot requested it to be removed ""multiple times"". The man is caught asking what he did, to which the officers can be seen telling him that he was ""disrespectful"" by ""arguing with the flight attendant"". However, he refused to get up from his seat after being told the reason leading to the officers handcuffing him and dragging him off the plane, the man could be heard screaming and crying as the officers pulled him away. \'You\'re an ally\' Virgin pilot leaves cockpit to eject \'immoral\' passenger in wild viral video The passenger aborted the flight mid-air after the cockpit door slammed An American Airlines first class passenger stormed off a flight after flight attendants refused his demand for a pre-departure beverage. pic.twitter.com/1DX9U5hBm5 — Breaking Aviation News amp; Videos (@aviationbrk) April 7, 2023 Did the passenger commit a crime? The passenger asked if he had committed a ""crime,"" but the US Department of Transportation states that a crime is not required to remove a passenger from a flight. The U.S. Department of Transportation\'s website states, ""Airlines may deny you boarding or remove you from a flight even after accepting your boarding pass and informing you that the reason for the denial or removal is a safety, security, or health risk, or obscene, due to conduct deemed disruptive or otherwise unlawful."" Another episode of \'Eligible Passengers\' People were quick to react against the guy for putting on a weird show with him crying. One Reddit user wrote, ""The cops didn\'t even do anything to him, he just ran away crying, WTF!"" Another commented, ""Yeah, this whole interaction reminds me of a Disney theme park in the late afternoon when the parent is so hot and tired and wants to leave, but the kid wants to stay and starts having a meltdown. I was waiting for the man-child to lie down on the ground and the police pulled him up."" While another said, ""I have never seen a more embarrassing performance in my entire career."" ""He should have stood up and walked out on his own,"" one person wrote on Twitter. I wonder how long they talked to him and how many times they asked him to get off the plane. Started with two, then went third. That man must obey it."" Another said, ""Another episode of ""entitled passengers"" to buy first class and think \'I own them\'"". On the other hand, many people were curious to know the whole story. One of them wrote, ""You are a first class (business) passenger, not an airline owner. Many people forget this on board. Anyway, I want to know the whole story. He should have stood up and walked out himself. I wonder how long they talked to him and how many times they asked him to get off the plane.

At least they did ask those who didn't get their dinner meal choices their breakfast preferences first, and tried to honor those Most of the flight attendants were not friendly. They snapped at customers who didn't have their shoulder straps on before we took off, aggressively scolded people for having laptops out while we were hanging out at the gate and not pushed back yet. No smiles. Lots of reprimands. This crew reminded me of past impressions of United flight attendants, where I felt like they hated all of us, and wished we'd just go away. (The crew on my flight from SF to SYD was considerably better - not great, but at least not openly, well, hostile?). That said, I lucked out later into the flight when my area was serviced by the one kind FA, who offered at least slightly friendly service, although certainly nothing above and beyond Food amp; DrinkThe SYD-SFO begins with a meal service about an hour or so after takeoff, and has a second meal two hours before landing, as per standard, regardless of timing of the flight (although for us, due to expected turbulence, second meal was served much earlier). Neither made sense as meals at coherent times, so, welcome dining service and before arrival , as dubbed on the menu, really do seem appropriate. There is also a cheese toastie and tomato soup available anytime that I did not see anyone get. In the galley mid-flight there was one kind of chips, one kind of packaged cookie, and Tim Tams. I still wish they'd add chocolate, and something else savory (popcorn?!), to that line up. Welcome Dining Service The first meal is the main lunch/dinner. Served around 3pm Sydney time, 9pm in San Francisco. So, late lunch? Even later dinner? Who knows. I of course went lounge hopping before, so this odd meal time just went along with my odd dining of the day Menu.The menu was nearly identical to the one I had on this flight 3 years prior (see review below). The appetizer was different, the salad the same, and 3/4 of the main dishes literally identical. 3 years apart, and essentially no change to catering. Sigh, United Starters Mesclun Salad with fennel, orange and cherry tomatoesAppetizer coronation salmon with butter lettuce, cilantro and vadouvan seasonings There is only one choice of appetizer, coronation salmon with butter lettuce, coriander and vadouvan seasonings, along with a mesclun salad. The appetizer was new for me. Not listed is the fact that all meals also come with bread, no choice There were four options for the main Seared Beef Filet Creamy peppercorn sauce, chive mashed potatoes, Broccolini, button mushrooms. Chicken Stuffed with Mint and Ricotta Smoked red pepper sauce, parsnip potato mash, carrot, shallot. Seared Barramundi fish fillet with tomato 'Nduja sauce, grilled green beans, barbecue tomatoes, toasted macadamia and fried capers. Cheese and Spinach Ravioli Pesto cream sauce, bell pepper, Broccolini, pumpkin. I opted for the seared barramundi, the only dish that was different from my previous flight (different only in the sauce and sides, it was barramundi last time too). The other dishes were literally identical, sauces, sides, and all. Like all United flights, they catered exactly 32 meals for 32 people, and only had 6 of the chicken, which everyone else seemed to want. They also had too few barramundi, but I think my status, r perhaps the snafu with not having my order taken, helped me secure one. I felt bad for everyone who wound up with the ravioli, as I had disliked it so before, and the beef, that looked like it got returned mostly untouched by most Dessert lineup was the made to order ice cream sundae, cheese platter, or apple crumble cake. I clearly went for the ice cream sundae, although I knew it would be slightly different from my US based flight, as I heard the FA telling others it was a different brand of ice cream. Dessert is served from a cart once everyone has completed their meals Meal service was a bit slow, but that was fine given the odd timing. Drinks and nuts were served close to an hour in, meals about 30 minutes later. The only lag that really bothered me was the long time before I finished eating, and dessert (and I was in the second to last row, one of the last to get my meal, and still it was ages before they even started the dessert cart service). It was more than 2 hours into the flight when I finally got my ice cream We were presented with a hot towel once underway, and were asked to take out our tables so they could put the placemat down. This was long before any actual meal service started, and a bit annoying, as it made working on my laptop harder My meal wasn't awful, but it certainly was not great French red wine, nuts Eventually a cart came through with drinks and warm nuts The pinot noir was the same Acacia that I did not like on my previous flight, so I decided to try another. I asked the FA to surprise me between the Justin Cabernet or the French red blend (that I didn't catch the name of). He let me try both. Neither was great, pretty acidic, but I went with the random French one. It at least had a bit of something to it, a touch of tanin that I appreciated. It grew on me throughout the meal. Yes, I'm finally growing up and getting into bigger wines. ***+ The nuts were again just almonds and cashews, lightly warm, not salted. Meh Meal.As always with United, the entire meal is served at once, the salad and appetizer and bread, no choice of any of these, plus your chosen main dish Dinner Roll United bread and I have an interesting relationship. I generally am not one to eat much in terms of dinner rolls/breads (yes, toast, yes bread pudding, but not normally side breads) in general. And yet ... sometimes I really like the United bread (specifically, the wheat one). But other ones, like the pretzel bread people like, I hate. This was a new one for me, a seeded roll. It was served slightly warm with a packaged butter on the side I actually liked it. It was soft, and didn't taste stale. The seeds gave flavor and crunch. I used it to mop up all the sauce from my appetizer (more on that soon) and really was pleased. ***+ Mesclun Salad. with fennel, orange and cherry tomatoes. The salad was fairly sad looking, a small portion of lightly wilted mixed greens, a single mealy tomato, and two hunks of what looked like canned citrus segments. Packaged dressing on the side. I quickly discarded the tomato/citrus/dressing, but used the limp greens as a base for the very heavily dressed (but strangely tasty) appetizer.*+ as it was, but actually **+ as it was useful to combine with the appetizer.Appetizer. Coronation salmon with butter lettuce, cilantro and vadouvan seasonings. Ok. This was, well, odd, and yet strangely delicious. And I wasn't just a captive hungry audience, having feasted plenty in the lounge. The base was a single piece of equally limp and wilty butter lettuce. United really does not do a great job with the fresh greens. And then a very, very, very heavily mayo dressed dish. I'm not familiar with coronation salmon , but, it was an adventure to eat. Amongst all that mayo there was ... chunks of fruit. I think little bits of mango? Soft and sweet. And then, crunchy pieces of celery. I tried really hard to find the salmon element, but literally couldn't find any. I think there might have been a little smoked salmon in there? This likely doesn't sound very good. Limp base lettuce, tons of mayo, and odd mix of celery, possibly mango, and seemingly no salmon? But when I put it over the other limp mixed greens, added some pepper, I actually really liked it. Oh, and the dressing was vadouvan based, and quite flavorful I later looked this up, and it seems it was their play on a more standard dish, coronation chicken, which is a fairly well known British dish, generally a sandwich filling, with cold chicken in a creamy curry base, with apricots or raisins, and almonds, originally served at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. Now that I read this, perhaps what I thought was mango was apricot? Definitely could have been, the soft fruit texture could easily be another stone fruit, and the curry dressing masked the precise flavor I used the bread to lap up every last bite of this strangely delicious dish. I'm still confused as to how this was so good, but, well, I really enjoyed it. Heavy, yes, but, totally satisfying. **** Main Seared Barramundi. with tomato 'Nduja sauce, grilled green beans, barbecue tomatoes, toasted macadamia and fried capers. And then there was the barramundi main dish. This honestly sounded great to me. I like barramundi, and enjoyed quite a bit of it during my time in Australia. I adore 'Nduja, and was super curious to see how they made a sauce from that. Definitely a fan of fried capers and macadamia. The grilled green beans and barbecue tomatoes sounded a bit odd, particularly with the other bits, but, I had hope The green beans were ok. I didn't taste anything grilled about them, but they weren't soggy or anything. I didn't really like them, but can't pinpoint really what it was. They were a touch oily as well I really did not care for the barbecue tomatoes, which turned out to be cherry tomatoes that were cooked. Not sure what was barbecue about them, again, no grill marks, nothing looked nor tasted barbecue about them. And I don't really like cooked tomatoes. Big meh to this And then, the toppings. I didn't really find any toasted macadamias. The fried capers were super salty, which was great to add salt to the dish, rather than shaking the tiny shaker incessantly just to get a few small grains. Capers and fish are also a good combo. The 'nduja sauce was ... sadly not great. I didn't taste any 'nduja. It was very oily, and separated. Not very good Barramundi Close Up And then there was the fish itself. On the plus side, my portion was quite large, considerably bigger than many photos I had seen of the dish. It was very moist ... or really, just very soft and a bit too mushy. Not awful, but, certainly not ideal, clearly cooked longer than it needed to be. At least it wasn't dry. It didn't taste fishy But my portion was largely dark meat, either entirely dark portions, or some really strewn with veins. I know barramundi normally has some of this, but it was excessive here. Only one end was nice white flesh Overall, I didn't really care for this dish. Meh to the veggies, sadly meh to the sauce, and eh to the quality of my piece of fish and heating of it. The dish really needed some acid, a bit of lemon would go far. ** Dessert Sundaew/ caramel, shaved almonds, strawberry goo, whipped cream, cherry Behold, the sundae! Yes, I'm a simple girl, and made to order ice cream sundaes on board make me pretty happy. This route is catered out of Australia, so has a different brand ice cream than I had on my flight over to Sydney. The FA was very enthusiastic about how great the ice cream was The topping lineup was chocolate or caramel sauce, nuts (slivered almonds), strawberry goo or cherries, and whipped cream. They usually also have chocolate chips/pieces, but they did not on this flight. Since I wanted to avoid all caffeine in any hopes of sleeping, I went for the caramel, nuts, fruit, and of course, the whipped topping. And yes, I had my own sprinkles with me The ice cream base was fine, not as remarkable as the FA seemed to think it was, but, decent enough. I got the last one on the cart, so it was fairly melty by the time it got to me. There was a bit of ice build up. Overall, fine, not special I really did like the caramel, sweet and smooth, and the slivered almonds for crunch. The strawberries in goo I found too sweet, definitely a rather cloying style. Fresh fruit would have been nicer. The cherry likewise was just too sweet, too candied. Note to self bring your own fresh fruit, skip their fruit toppings. The whipped cream was fine Overall, fairly average, but still nice to have on board. Other airlines have better ice cream (Air New Zealand in particular has great ice cream), but, the toppings are quite nice. ***+ Dessert 2 Apple Crumble Bar Later in the flight, when I went to use the bathroom, all the extra apple crumble bars and cheese platters were set up in the galley, so I was able to try the apple crumble as well, even though not my first choice It was about as mediocre as I expected. The base was fine, a sort shortbread like soft cookie, and the crumble top was fine too, again, sorta shortbread like, but very soft, very pale. It was sweet enough and not dry, although a bit ... doughy? The filling I really didn't care for though, it was the style of apple filling that is basically a few soft small pieces of apple in a spiced applesauce. Even generic canned pie filling goo I like more than this. Just, way too strong on the applesauce dimension for my taste. The crumble top might be nice sprinkled on the ice cream The lady behind me got it from the dessert cart, and asked to have caramel and whipped cream from the ice cream sundae cart added, which definitely would help, but even so, I can't say this is a winner for me. *+ After Dinner Drink Port To go along with dessert, I was offered an after dinner drink, with options of Bailey's, port, or amaretto. The FA apologized that they didn't have more options, and lamented the loss of others, taken away during Covid, and not resumed The port was fine. Not great, not bad. My glass did have a lot of sediment however. Not as caramely as the Air New Zealand one. Nice alongside the sundae though. *** BreakfastThe last time I flew this route, the breakfast options were cereal or an omelet. This time was more interesting, with a choice of Spinach, feta, and rosemary fritatta with roasted potatoes and chicken sausage Smashed avocado toast with Feta crumbles, hard boiled egg, pickled red onion, seasoned seed mix and grilled lime Fairy bread french toast This pales in comparison to Air New Zealand's offering that starts with fresh smoothies, then a lineup of continental items like multiple yogurts, cereals, muesli, fruit, then a passed basket of assorted pastries, and THEN your choice of main dish, but at least it was slightly more interesting. Breakfast orders are not taken in advance, so they do wake everyone up earlier in order to do the breakfast service, unlike say Qantas where you fill out a card before you go to bed Breakfast Tray My choice was easy, as I don't like feta (or fritattas) and I'm allergic to avocado. Plus, um, Fairy bread! I'm sure for most Americans they don't know what this is, and the menu gives no description, but I'm well aware of what Fairy Bread is, although, not usually served as French Toast All meals also come with a croissant with jam and butter, and usually fruit salad, but the fruit had melons, and I'm allergic. So my platter was carbs with carbs. There is no yogurt, not even packaged, nor cereal on offer for something simple and fast. Coffee. Black The coffee was lower end mediocre. Not horrible, but not very good. ** Fairy Bread French Toast For the unfamiliar, Fairy Bread is a very simple dish, normally served at kid's birthday parties. Cheap basic white bread, spread with margarine or butter, and topped with 100s amp; 1000s (sprinkles). I was curious to see how United turned that into a breakfast dish as french toast Let's just say, um, they took some creative license here. Calling it fairy bread inspired french toast would perhaps be more accurate. Yes, it was bread, and yes it had 100s amp; 1000s, but, fairy bread it was not. Nor was it actually french toast. It was served just as is, no syrup, no whipped cream, no butter. It wasn't awful. It also wasn't great, but somehow some of its not-so-good qualities made it work. It also really was not breakfast appropriate. This was a dessert. Coconut fairy bread pudding-in-slice-form is the most accurate description I can come up with. So, what was it? Well, two slices of bread, that were moist in an odd way. They looked gummy, particularly on the underside, but weren't exactly. The batter/soak/whatever it was was not a traditional french toast soak, no cinnamon, and honestly, I didn't really detect any egg either. It wasn't pan cooked, but rather, clearly just baked. It seemed more custardy, again, more like bread pudding, but, sliced. The bottom was particularly soft/custardy, in a way that was off putting if you were expecting, well, french toast, but worked fine as a bread pudding dessert The topping was not just 100s amp; 1000s, but also, shredded coconut. The coconut was unexpected, not listed on the menu, and I can imagine being a problem for those with allergies. The coconut added a tiny bit of crunch and texture. Overall, this was very sweet, I think the batter/soak was sweetened, plus all those sprinkles, so it certainly didn't need any syrup, although I think it would be decent with a fruit compote or something besides just the sugar and coconut. Or really, some fresh fruit - mango or kiwi go great with the coconut and tropical theme (which I actually had with me, because I knew I couldn't eat the United fruit with breakfast as it generally contains melons, and I'm allergic. So my supply of strawberries, blueberries, kiwi, and mango turned out even more useful than I was expecting - I put the strawberries on my sundae after dinner when I didn't really like their strawberry goo, and used the kiwi and mango with this. Perfect!). I actually also had some whipped cream with me (on ice, don't worry!), and added it, and enjoyed it far more than way, but, really, at that point I was eating dessert. If you could ever convince a FA to serve it to you with the ice cream after dinner (or just the whipped cream from the sundae cart), I think that would be a winning move. * as fairy bread, * as french toast, but somehow ***+ as a dessert dish Croissant, Jam, Butter The breakfast bread everyone got was a croissant, a different style entirely from the one I had on my SFO-SYD flight, which was extremely bready, very pale, and more crescent shaped. This one was considerably better - decent buttery flavor, but not flaky or with laminated layers. It was not too dry, stale, nor spongy. Certainly not a real fresh bakery croissant, but ok-ish. With my main dish being entirely sweet carbs though, I didn't find myself really wanting more sweet carbs at this point, but I bet that coronation salmon appetizer stuffed into it would make a great lunch sandwich. So while I'm adding to my hacks, ask for your breakfast croissant with the dinner entree to make a tasty sandwich ...**+.Original Review, May 2020 Flight Details Flight UA870 Departure 2pm SYD Arrival 9am SFO Aircraft B777-300 Seat 17A (window) This was, my first time, really flying United Airlines. Almost literally. I've done one shorter domestic flight, but other than that ... uh, I avoid it. And I have my preferred route from Sydney to San Francisco, on Air New Zealand that I generally adore, and have reviewed many times (e.g. the AKL-SFO leg). I could have taken my standard route, but decided to take advantage of the fact that United was flying the best Polaris offering (on the 777-300) for a limited time for the summer. If I was ever going to like United, this would be it. Plus, while I love the Air New Zealand experience (the staff, the food, the wine, etc), and the timing makes sleep pleasant at the time, I always suffer from pretty bad jetlag on the return. The idea of a long day flight wasn't appealing, but I was curious to see how it really would work out. I did find the flight attendants generally entirely impersonal, although I had one I liked. Service style was more of a am I done with you yet? rather than is there anything I can do for you? Literally, never asked, Can I get you anything else? and lots of attempting to take away my half-finished glass of water. I also found there to be a lot more ... rules than other airlines. Shoulder straps required for take-off and landing (ok? At least the lap belt *didn't* have airbag and wasn't uncomfortable.) Laptops powered off for takeoff and landing (not just closed or wifi off?) Mandatory closing of the shades while we were still wrapping up meal service. Etc. It felt very rigid. The flight did take off to a rocky start, literally, with significant turbulence for ... hours. Our seatbelt sign was on the majority of the first 3 hours, and the FAs kept getting ordered to return to their seats. They valiantly attempted meal service over and over again, but, it was rough when they kept getting asked to sit. Meal Overview. Besides the turbulence though, there were no United horror stories for me, and it matched what I expected - the hard product was great, the bedding exceptional, the food low end quality and service style, and general service was meh . Lower end of international business class in many regards, except that amazing bed ... Amenities The soft product is the first part of the Polaris experience that United rolled out, so there has been plenty written about this stuff. I'll just give a quick take on it all. But yes, premium offering on the bedding front. allTheBedding I arrived at my seat to find, as everyone says, all the bedding. Made by Saks Fifth Avenue. I appreciate the great bedding, but, when you arrive with your hands full and the seat is full, its kinda annoying. And its awkward to cram into the overhead bins, and, um, someone took my blanket once I did so. Anyway. At the seat was a light blanket (super comfy, stylish too), a big pillow (*really* comfortable, zomg), a small blue cooling gel pillow, and a rolled up very thin comforter. I was a little surprised the comforter was so thin, but, I also know flights are often crazy warm, so this didn't concern me. It turned out to be huge, much wider than most, and I really liked it. And the gel cooling pillow really did make a difference for the first few hours. I also knew to ask for a mattress pad, as they are limited, and people recommend asking for one the moment you board. It doesn't actually connect to the seat though, and I found it bunched up a lot. There was much stuff to keep around though, and not anywhere to really put it. I did ask for any extras as I always like an extra pillow or two (to put between my knees and to create a nest), and usually like an extra blanket, but alas, they didn't have any extras. I was given an extra very very thin tiny pillow from economy at least. Slippers. In my foot well I found slippers, and they were far above average. Really fluffy and comfy. I loved them. Pajamas. I also knew to ask for pajamas immediately, available in only 2 sizes S/M and M/L. They were HUGE. And not that great. The fabric was quite comfortable, thin style so good for a warm flight, but, the pants were just elastic waist (no string) and since they were too big, they wouldn't stay up, even when I rolled them over. No pockets either. The top was a simple long sleeve. Not sure why people get excited about these, easily some of the less interesting pajamas I've had on flights (besides the nice soft fabric). Amenity Kit. Inside my cubby I found an amenity kit. It had all the standard things pen, low end eye mask and earplugs, disposable toothbrush, etc. Socks. The socks were ... fine. Glad to have so my own good socks didn't get all airplane, but, they didn't exactly fit a foot, all just a big tube. I prefer the Air New Zealand (or, really, JetBlue socks). Sunday Riley items. I did appreciate face cream, hand cream, and a face cloth though. Seat Everyone says that Polaris is a wonderful hard product, and, well I agree. I quite liked my seat. I picked an odd number A seat, the last one available, so row 17. Odd seats are the ones staggered next to the window, so it was very private, the aisle far away, and I could see no one else. Because I'm right handed the A side is preferred as the generous side table is on the right. 17A View Hello, Engines. The noise level at my seat however was very high, due to being engine adjacent. I knew it was going to be rough the moment the engines were turned on. The drone of the engines really wore on me after a while. I tried listening to music, but, the limited music selection wasn't very appealing, and, the headphones really didn't block much at all anyway. Entertainment Center. The large entertainment screen is directly in front of the seat, and has both a touch screen and side controller. I didn't use much from it, but was quite disappointed by the very limited music selection - no individual artists, just mixed, and just one per genre. Below the screen was a tiny slot, only deep enough to store a menu (or hand wipes or gum, little else), then the tray table slid out under that. There was a storage well at the floor level that was not very tall but fit my little bag with no problem, and the foot well was nicely positioned to rest my feet (once I extended the leg of the seat). Dining Table Full mode. I really appreciated the tray table design. It slid straight out for service, got plenty close, and you could still get in and out of the seat with it there. Seriously, one of the best designed trays I've seen. Dining Table Half mode. It also went into a half mode, either by flipping it in half, or, just pushing it part way in. Super handy, as you could use it to set a few things, and still have plenty of lap space. This was very useful in the phases between courses, where I could just slide it back in and out of the way. Storage Cubby. The only other in-seat storage is a cubby above the entertainment controllers and in-seat power, but it was deep enough to stash a few things, had a mirror inside, and had the lackluster headphones hanging in it. Regular power and 2 USB were provided. Side Table. The best feature of the seat was the really large side table, right under the cubby. Since I was in an odd A seat, this was on the right hand side, and I'm right handed. It was my privacy buffer but also ridiculously handy for placing nearly anything and everything. Laptop. Drinks. Items for crew to take away. Basically, everything. I loved having this. Again, well designed seat. The lamp added a homey touch. Seat Controls. The seat controls took some figuring out. There is a rocker that kinda controls the main function, and then 3 other +/- buttons (lumbar, leg rest, and ... something). I definitely had to fiddle with it quite a bit. The seat style is the kind that just slides flat to sleep, which was the setting at one end of the rocker. It was actually very comfortable for sleep, not too firm (with mattress pad), and it didn't slope. It was narrow though, and it was hard to sleep on one side. It was pretty comfortable to sit in, once I figured out a good position. Food and Drink United is definitely not known for quality catering. I was definitely sad to be not flying on Air New Zealand as usual as I do often love their food, but, alas, I was willing to try something new. It was ... basically as expected . Some of it really bad, the wine better than I expected at least, and the ice cream sundae station lived up to its reputation. Welcome Dining Service Like many airlines, meal service began nearly as soon as it was safe to move around the cabin. This was 2 40pm, and a very awkward time to dine, particularly given my lounge hopping. To start, we were given blue placemats, and then drinks and nuts were served from a cart. I haven't actually seen this done before - usually beverage orders are taken before takeoff, or immediately after, and delivered one by one. As the bathroom was ahead of my seat, and both aisles had their own carts, it was pretty inconvenient, as the aisle was blocked immediately once the seatbelt sign was off. Warm Nuts, Red Wine, Sparkling Water. Wines on offer were a Spanish white or riesling for whites, a cabernet sauvignon and a red blend for reds. I asked to try both, and a small pour was provided, and then I selected the one I liked more. Cart service *does* have its benefits! The red blend was very bold, but didn't seem balanced, a bit acidic and harsh though. It was fine, but I liked the cab more. A very generous pour was provided. Air New Zealand definitely wins on the wine front though. I was also happy to see Dasani sparkling lime rather than just plain sparkling water, and I was offered the full can. And a final nice touch? The nuts were nicely warm. Just almonds and cashews, no interesting nuts, no seasoning, but still, they were fine. Welcome Dining Service Menu. I think they realize the time is odd, so, not called lunch, not called dinner, it was called, Welcome Dining Service . The menu consists of a round of starters (no choice, both vegetarian), a choice of entree (yup, your classic chicken, beef, fish, or pasta, order taken before takeoff), and a vague dessert lineup. In full Starters Chilled Appetizer Tomato, mozzarella, Kalamata olive, basil, balsamic glaze. Salad Mixed greens, fennel, cherry tomato, orange. Served with dressing and assorted breads. Entree Seared Beef Filet Creamy peppercorn sauce, chive mashed potatoes, Broccolini, button mushrooms. Chicken Stuffed with Mintbush and Ricotta Smoked red pepper sauce, parsnip potato mash, carrot, shallot. Seared Barramundi fish fillet Lemon myrtle cream sauce, crushed garlic potatoes, green beans, cherry tomato, spicd coconut and chili. Cheese and Spinach Ravioli Pesto cream sauce, bell pepper, Broccolini, pumpkin. Desserts International Cheese Assortment Served with grapes, crackers, and port. Signature Sundae Served with a choice of toppings. Sweet Treats Please ask your flight attendant for today's selections. The starters sounded entirely boring to me (I was missing Air New Zealand's excellent smoked fish and duck options ... ), and the entrees, while they sounded promising given the descriptions, I've heard such bad things about. Only dessert was exciting. For an entree, I was tempted to get the beef (not for the beef, lol, if an airline that everyone says has good catering can rarely get this right, like I'd get it from United ... but the mashed chive potatoes and sauce sounded good). I was tempted to get the chicken (not for the chicken, I hate chicken! but for the parsnip potato mash and stuffing). I was tempted to get the barramundi, as I do actually like fish, and wanted the cream sauce and garlic potatoes, but I just didn't believe they could possibly prepare it well. Which left ravioli, the only real safe option usually on a flight with subpar catering get the pasta! And yes, the Broccolini showed up in not one but two dishes, and was Capitalized both time. Broccolini, so exciting! Desserts though sounded great, although I wished I knew what the sweet treats were, and what the sundae toppings would be ... Starters Chilled Appetizer and Salad . The starters also came from a cart (along with more beverages, same cart), alas, nearly immediately after the nuts and drinks. Again, trapped unable to access a bathroom, there wasn't one behind me besides way back in economy (premium economy doesn't have their own?) Tomato, mozzarella, Kalamata olive, basil, balsamic glaze. This looked horrible, and since it isn't things I like anyway, I didn't try it. The tomatoes looked horribly mealy. Mixed greens, fennel, cherry tomato, orange. Served with dressing and assorted breads. The salad was ... fine. The greens reasonably fresh and at least an interesting variety. I was not into the vinaigrette though, and it was the only option. No oil and vinegar even, but you know I'm always prepared, had my won dressing, and additional toppings. A bread basket was offered as well, with basic rolls and garlic bread. Entree Cheese and Spinach Ravioli. Pesto cream sauce, bell pepper, Broccolini, pumpkin. My entree should have been delivered soon after, but ... We are sorry, your meal wasn't actually cooked. It will be a while, I hope that is ok. Uh, thanks? I just hoped it came before the sundae cart, because I wanted in on that!!! Luckily (?) for me, the FAs got required to sit because of turbulence soon after, so dessert service was not able to start, and my meal cooked during that time. Well, this was a partial hit, but mostly not at all. The Broccolini was just as front and center as the menu implied, two large pieces, right on top. BROCCOLINI. I didn't try it, not my thing. I also avoided the red bell pepper chunks, again, not my thing. I really liked the pumpkin, it was well cooked, not too mushy, and went great with the creamy sauce. Speaking of the sauce, it was a bit oily, and had broken, clearly, but it was creamy and herby and tasty. It didn't scream pesto and I did expect more strong flavor, but, the herbs were nice. But then ... there was the ravioli. Wow it was bad. Very, very, very bad. The pasta was dried out in places, but that wasn't the problem. The texture was just horrible. It was mush. Even the dried out part was mush. Truly horrible. The filling was just ricotta (where was the spinach?), and had no seasoning. It was also mush. So, the ravioli? Really horrible, honestly, the worst pasta I've had on a plane, from a buffet, from ... anywhere really. But the cream sauce and squash was tasty. I was very very glad I had prepared for the flight by feasting on dim sum and mac and cheese (mediocre) in the Singapore Airlines lounge, the fabulous pasta in the Air New Zealand lounge instead. Dessert Cart. And then it was time for the dessert cart!! Oh yes. Now, this may or may not have been the reason I was willing to consider flying on United. Sweet Treats Red Velvet Cupcake. Sweet Treats Please ask your flight attendant for today's selections. The sweet treats for the day were brownies, macaroons ,and cupcakes (red velvet or coconut orange). I opted for a red velvet, just ... to try. I was very surprised with the cupcake. It wasn't moist, and didn't taste like red velvet, but ... I kinda liked it. The frosting was crazy sweet, but I liked that too. I don't know why, but I liked this thing. Signature Sundae. Signature Sundae Served with a choice of toppings. The ice cream was just vanilla, but of course, the exciting part is the sundae, made to order at your seat. Toppings were classic hot fudge or caramel, strawberries in goo, whipped cream, slivered almond, marashino cherries. No sprinkles, but of course I had my own. I'll admit, it was pretty fabulous. I got ... everything but caramel. The hot fudge wasn't particularly indulgent, but it was thick, rich, and far better than chocolate sauce. The strawberries in goo I actually loved - soft, sweet, and the goo went great with the chocolate. I added some crumble shortcake biscuit to it all as well, and that was just perfect. The whipped cream, slivered almonds, and cherry were standard. I really enjoyed my sundae, particularly once I added the crumbled shortcake biscuit, basically, a strawberry shortcake a la mode and whipped cream! Port. And yet, the meal kept on giving. I skipped the cheese from the cart, but I gladly accepted a pour of port. It wasn't as good as Air New Zealand port that I adore, but it was quite good, just lacked some more sophisticated caramel undertones. Arrival Dining Service A La Carte amp; Arrival Dining Service Menus. The other food option during the rest of the flight is a anytime a la carte menu offering the pantry snacks, or, instructing you to ask for grilled cheese and tomato soup or shepherd's pie. If I thought it had any hope, I'd definitely go fro that shepherd's pie pie, always a favorite dish of mine, but, yeah, I had no hope. And then, the breakfast options. Um. Yeah. I've actually never seen such a sparse, and completely not customizable, breakfast menu in international business class. But hey, at least they didn't interrupt my precious sleep with elaborate breakfast? 2 options. The cold one or the hot one. Both served with yogurt, breakfast breads, butter, and fruit preserves. Cheese omelet with Chicken sausage, Lyonnaise potatoes. Served with fruit. Fresh seasonal fruit. Served with cereal and milk. Yes, really. Would you like fruit and cereal or fruit and an omelet/sausage/potatoes? And no, there was not even a choice of cereal, Cornflakes only. Only! No granola or anything. But I'm ahead of myself, this detail isn't on the menu. The menu just said cereal . Coffee. And of course, coffee. The regular coffee was pretty bad. Harsh. I asked for decaf as well, and was told bluntly, it is instant, it is not very good, do you still want it? I was a bit surprised as the menu boasted Illy for both regular and decaf, but that didn't seem true. Given the pushback, I gave up and didn't bother try the decaf. Cold Breakfast Tray.

To see those, remove the filter on the hotels.com search page When you are ready to book your flight or hotel, please use the links on our site to begin your booking process so we receive credit for the referral Tips Rent a car for cheaper by using Priceline\'s ""Express Deals"". The rental car company will be hidden until after you purchase, but this allows those companies to undercut the published rate indirectly. You can remove low quality companies from those hidden results. The trick is to use the quality filter on their website to remove any rental car company with a review rating under 7.0 and then pick the deals that survive the filter Tips The Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card allows for 1-to-1 point transfers to several airline loyalty programs. Booking with points is a good alternative to paying with cash when the price of airfare is high. Here is the current list of Chase Sapphire transfer partners United, Southwest, jetBlue, British Airways, Iberia, Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Air France, KLM, Virgin Atlantic, Aer Lingus, and Air Canada Tips Vacation rentals on Vrbo are usually cheaper per night for longer stays than shorter stays. This is due to three main factors; The first is that most properties have a cleaning fee that is a fixed rate, the second is that many hosts provide discounts for stays longer than 6-days, the third is that the Vrbo service fee percentage is higher on short stays Tips You can (and should) sort the Vrbo vacation rental search results by ""Total"" price. Doing so exposes properties with high fees. For example, a 140 per-night property with 100 fees will rank as being more expensive than a 150 per-night property with 30 fees, when sorted. Sorting by ""most reviews"" is also a good option, as this will show you the most popular properties Tips Use Tripadvisor to create a Hotel ""short list"". First, plug in your dates and destination. Then select ""Sort by Traveler Ranked"". Finally, select the ""Traveler Ranking"" filter to show ""only 4* and up"". Use this resulting ""short list"" of hotels to find the cheapest one with a high ranking Tips Hotel rates for Weekend dates are usually higher than the rates for Sunday through Thursday. Tripadvisor has a color-coded date calendar, red when the average hotel price for that day is more expensive, green for less expensive. You can use this to get an overview of what dates in the month are at a discount Tips Different booking websites will often have differing routes, prices, and availability. Before you finalize your purchase, do a quick check on BookingBuddy, Skyscanner, and Kayak to see if any other site or airline is offering a better deal Join our instant notification Telegram Channels (New York / Chicago amp; Milwaukee / Denver / Los Angeles / Seattle / Portland / Houston / Dallas / Austin amp; San Antonio) Follow us on Instagram (New York / Chicago / Los Angeles / Seattle / Portland / Denver / Houston / Dallas / Austin amp; San Antonio) Say Hello on Twitter (New York / Chicago / Los Angeles / Seattle amp; Portland / Denver / Houston / Dallas / Austin amp; San Antonio) Like us on Facebook (New York / Chicago / Los Angeles / Seattle / Portland / Denver / Houston / Dallas / Austin amp; San Antonio) I was able to pull this up on Expedia and Priceline.

This year\'s planned initiatives focus on strengthening the Hub of the Americas® in Panama City, it\'s primary connection center in the region. The airline has plans to increase its network of destinations and flight frequencies, as well as growing and improving its fleet of aircraft. Speaking on the announcement of its 2023 expansion plan, Pedro Heilbron, Chief Executive Officer at Copa Airlines said ""Copa Airlines has been investing in Panama for more than 75 years, which has helped us become the leading airline in the region."" ""Turning the Hub of the Americas® into Latin America\'s preferred connection by facilitating connectivity and contributing in boosting the economic, social, and tourism sectors of both Panama and Latin America."" ""To remain sustainable and thrive in the current complex and competitive environment, the airline seeks to boost its growth, generate jobs, and increase our direct contributions to the country\'s economy."" Copa Airlines fleet additions As part of their 2023 plans, Copa Airlines confirmed the recent addition of 15 new B737MAX aircraft, an investment of 2.1 billion, to their latest order. These aircraft are additions to the existing 2015 order and are expected to be delivered within the next 5 years. In 2023, the airline expects to receive six additional Boeing 737 MAX9, bringing its current fleet to a total of 99 airplanes, comprising 32 B737 MAX9, 58 B737 800NB, and 9 B-737-7000NG. Training fleet refurbishment Copa Airlines is also planning to refurbish the training fleet of the Latin American Aviation Academy (ALAS) by acquiring 8 new Diamond DA40/42 airplanes. The aircraft will be equipped with cutting-edge technology, which will facilitate the learning process while adhering to the highest safety standards. In addition, these airplanes are eco-friendly, consuming up to 50% less fuel than the ones being replaced, ensuring a greener and more sustainable future for the airline industry. Copa Airlines also announced the acquisition of a fifth flight simulator B737MAX to enhance the training of its pilots. This new addition will increase the airline\'s training capacity needed to help meet the growing demands of Copa Airlines. Strengthening Panama connectivity During the first quarter of 2023, Copa Airlines will introduce three new destinations including Baltimore and Austin in the United States, and Manta in Ecuador, for a total of 80 destinations in 33 countries throughout the Americas. The airline\'s international connectivity surpasses that of other hubs in the region, making it a competitive advantage for Panama. The Hub of the Americas® plays a strategic role in the country\'s economy, and its unique connectivity has attracted airlines from around the world to complement their flights to the Central American country. By incorporating three new routes and increasing flight frequencies to a variety of destinations, Copa Airlines estimates an 11% growth in the number of passengers in 2023 compared to 2022. At the end of 2023, it expects to transport 16.1 million passengers while operating 328 daily flights, exceeding pre-pandemic levels. Increasing tourism in Panama The carrier will be instrumental in developing both tourism and the regional economy in the Panama region as it progresses through 2023. Copa Airlines will continue to implement successful initiatives that promote tourism and economic growth in Panama, such as the ""Panama Stopover"" program, which encourages in-transit passengers to spend a few days in the country. Since 2019, the program has attracted more than 260,000 visitors, and it is estimated that over 115,000 tourists will take advantage of the Panama Stopover in 2023. In addition, Copa continues to market promotional fares to Panama through the ""Irresistible Panama"" initiative, which accomplished a visitor increase of 27% onboard the airline\'s flights. It also contributed to the promotion and publicity of the country through its social media channels, copa.com, and other advertising spaces owned by the brand such as Panorama, Copa\'s onboard magazine. At the same time, the airline\'s growth will continue to positively benefit the production and progress of local businesses since 100% of the products used onboard Copa flights are 100% Panamanian for the enjoyment of millions of passengers that travel with the airline throughout the continent. Currently, small Panamanian businesses such as Café Rogusta, Comercializadora Nico and F amp;F Foods, are the primary providers of products available onboard Copa flights.

While even passengers in economy are granted thoughtful touches, like a hot towel service and a well-stocked amenity kit (which includes toothpaste, a toothbrush, socks, and eye shades), nothing is as luxurious as the first-class suites. Exclusively available on the airline\'s A380 aircraft, Travel + Leisure previously reported that the suites are like ""hotel rooms in the sky"" — and they\'re like nothing you\'ve ever seen before. Currently, the A380 services six destinations worldwide Frankfurt Airport, Hong Kong International Airport, London Heathrow, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport in Mumbai, Sydney Airport, and John F.

The Boeing 777-300ER will take its place, and while this is not-so-great news for U.S. travelers who want to experience the suites, the 777 aircraft still has a first-class cabin that provides plenty of privacy and comfort — passengers just won\'t have the option of creating a double bed.

Created by Singapore Airline\'s International Culinary Panel and changed based on ingredient availability and seasonality, the menus can also be viewed by scanning a QR code in flight or previewed online up to eight days before takeoff. Options vary by flight, but you\'ll find a range of delicacies, including grilled salmon, Singapore chicken rice, and lobster thermidor. Additionally, the airline makes sure to provide options for all special dietary requirements.

What happens when Spirit Airlines merges with JetBlue? As I mentioned earlier, I have never flown Spirit Airlines. And I don\'t have any current plans to start. However, I\'m intrigued by this offer because of the pending acquisition by JetBlue. The JetBlue acquisition is on a bit of shaky ground right now. There are pending lawsuits by the Department of Justice and attorney generals from several states. This uncertainty makes people concerned that it may not actually happen. It\'s hard to tell if these lawsuits will stop the acquisition, change the terms of the deal, or cause JetBlue to divest some aspects of its business. My assumption is that JetBlue will honor the elite status of Free Spirit members once the acquisition finalizes. However, nobody knows when exactly that will happen, given the lawsuits mentioned above. For less than 100, I think status matching for elite status is a worthy investment. And once you have Spirit Airlines elite status, you may even be tempted to fly the airline. With elite status perks, like the ability to waive fees and upgrade to a better seat, it shouldn\'t be as bad as you might fear.

Most Free Spirit members with status in a hotel or airline program should be able to take advantage of the deal, but it comes with a fee How does ValuePenguin get paid? Advertiser disclosure Airline status match programs can help you get your elite status from one carrier matched by the next, but they usually come with plenty of fine print. For example, your newly matched status typically only lasts a few months and lapses if you don't meet a specific flight requirement with the airline. Spirit Airlines just launched a new status match program that is slightly different than many other ones. Essentially, this new status match deal lets you get your elite status matched using elite status from 16 different frequent flyer programs and 16 different hotel brands. Your newly matched status will also last a full 12 months without any flight requirements, which makes the program even more alluring. Of course, there's a catch. The airline's Free Spirit status match is a paid program, and it'll set you back either 49 or 99 depending on the new tier of status you hope to get. With this in mind, you may be wondering if this program is worth the trouble or the cost. Read on to find out more about Spirit's new status match deal, how it works and reasons to consider it. How Spirit Airlines new status match program works Spirit Airlines offers two different tiers of elite status you can work toward — Free Spirit Silver and Free Spirit Gold. Both tiers of elite status from Spirit are attainable through the status match program, although different requirements apply to qualify for either one. For example, lower tier elite status with participating airlines and hotels (like Alaska MVP, American Gold and Delta Silver) lets you match to Free Spirit Silver, whereas mid-tier and higher elite status tiers with other airlines and hotels (like American Platinum or higher, JetBlue Mosaic and Delta Gold or higher) will match to Free Spirit Gold. The good news is that a large number of airline and hotel programs will work with this deal, enabling most Spirit frequent flyers with status in another program to take advantage of it Participating hotel brands Accor Best Western Choice Hotels International GHA Hilton Hyatt IHG Marriott Omni Hotels amp; Resorts Radisson Hotel Group Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts Sonesta Taj Hotels The Leading Hotels of The World World Hotels Wyndham Hotels and Resorts If you succeed at getting your status matched by Spirit, you'll get the following perks that vary by tier Free Spirit SilverFree Spirit GoldAbility to host a Points PoolDedicated Guest Care support\\ Redemption Fee WaiverExit Row seat assignmentShortcut BoardingShow All Rows However, there are a few fine print details you should know about with this program. For example, the status match deal only provides benefits for flights you book after your new status is approved. This means you won't get any new elite status perks for Spirit flights you booked previously but haven't flown yet. In addition, people who applied for a Spirit status match in the last two years are ineligible for this promotion. Is the Spirit status match worth it? Quite a few factors help the Spirit Airlines status match program stand out, including the fact it lets you match elite status with other major airlines, but also with hotel loyalty programs. Not only that, but you get to enjoy your new elite status perks for 12 full months, and there are no flight requirements to keep up with during that time. As mentioned, you'll have to pay a 49 fee for Silver status or a 99 fee for Gold status, which may leave you wondering if the investment is truly worth it. It seems likely that Spirit flyers will get good value from the program if they fly with Spirit at least a few times in the next 12 months, and they can qualify for Gold status. That's because Gold status comes with the most money-saving benefits. Free Spirit Gold offers free carry-on and checked luggage and a seat selection benefit when you purchase a flight. The airline charges 1 to 200 for seat assignments requested in advance depending on the specifics of your flight. Carry-on bags and checked baggage can easily cost 60 or more per leg of your flight as well, depending on your itinerary. Gold status could easily get you more than 99 in savings on these charges with just a few flights. The bottom line While getting elite status with Spirit Airlines may not be as rewarding as achieving similar status with a major U.S. carrier, it's easy to see why you would want it if you actually fly with this discount airline. Having early boarding is always nice, and Free Spirit Gold status lets you avoid having to pay extra for carry-on bags, checked bags and a seat assignment. Then again, Spirit Airlines does offer a co-branded airline credit card that earns points toward elite status. You could use it as an alternative for working toward status with the airline if you don't want to pay for status match. ""]",0.9519259

Theo quy định tại khoản 1 Điều 8 Thông tư 96/2020/TT-BTC ngày 16/11/2020 của Bộ trưởng Bộ Tài chính hướng dẫn công bố thông tin trên thị trường chứng khoán "" Đối tượng công bố thông tin được tạm hoãn công bố thông tin trong trường hợp vì những lý do bất khả kháng như Thiên tai, hỏa hoạn, chiến tranh, dịch bệnh và các lý do bất khả kháng khác… "" Theo đề nghị của Tổng Công ty tại công văn số 354/TCTHK-VP, lý do xin tạm hoãn công bố thông tin không thuộc trường hợp được tạm hoãn công bố thông tin theo quy định tại khoản 1 Điều 8 Thông tư 96/20202/TT-BTC. Do đó, UBCKNN đề nghị công ty khẩn trương khắc phục công tác kế toán để hoàn thành công bố thông tin theo quy định. Trước đó, vào cuối tháng 3/2023, Vietnam Airlines đã có văn bản xin tạm hoãn CBTT Báo cáo tài chính kiểm toán năm 2022, song không đưa ra thời gian cụ thể. Nguyên nhân là do Vietnam Airlines cần thêm thời gian cho việc đối chiếu báo cáo, xác nhận báo cáo, tổng hợp số liệu tuân thủ chuẩn mực kiểm toán. Đối với công ty mẹ, trong năm 2022, Vietnam Airlines đã thực hiện tái cơ cấu, sắp nhập 5 đơn vị trực thuộc, tiến hành đóng mã số thuế tại các chi nhánh được sáp nhập nên công tác đối chiếu số liệu báo cáo giữa các cơ quan, đơn vị bị kéo dài. Văn bản xin tạm hoãn của Vietnam Airlines còn cho biết, trong giai đoạn ảnh hưởng của đại dịch Covid-19, tổng công ty đã đàm phán và được nhiều nhà cung cấp nước ngoài chấp thuận (có điều kiện) cho phép được giảm giá hàng hoá dịch vụ, giãn hoãn các khoản thanh toán. Do có các điều kiện thay đổi trong việc thực hiện hợp đồng, Vietnam Airlines cần nhiều thời gian hơn để đối chiếu xác nhận công nợ đáp ứng chuẩn mực kiểm toán. Căn cứ Nghị định 155/2020/NĐ-CP năm 2020 quy định cổ phiếu của công ty đại chúng bị hủy bỏ niêm yết khi kết quả kinh doanh bị thua lỗ trong 3 năm liên tục hoặc tổng số lỗ luỹ kế vượt quá số vốn điều lệ thực góp hoặc vốn chủ sở hữu âm trong báo cáo tài chính kiểm toán năm gần nhất. Do vậy, nếu không có thay đổi quan trọng nào trong báo cáo tài chính năm 2022 có kiểm toán sắp tới, hơn 2,2 tỷ cổ phiếu Vietnam Airlines sẽ bị buộc phải rời sàn HoSE theo quy định. Theo BCTC hợp nhất tự lập quý 4/2022, Vietnam Airlines ghi nhận doanh thu thuần năm 2022 đạt 70.500 tỷ đồng, gấp 2,5 lần cùng kỳ. Tuy nhiên, gánh nặng chi phí đã khiến hãng hàng không này lỗ ròng hơn 10.400 tỷ đồng năm 2022. HVN giải trình, kết quả thua lỗ là do chi phí nguyên liệu tăng và chi phí bán hàng tăng tương ứng với doanh số bán hàng. Ngoài khoản lỗ của công ty mẹ thì khoản lỗ của cả Pacific Airlines và Công ty Dịch vụ mặt đất đều tăng. Với việc lỗ nặng 3 năm liên tiếp, Vietnam Airlines đang lỗ lũy kế hơn 34.000 tỷ đồng, vốn chủ sở hữu âm hơn 10.000 tỷ đồng vào cuối năm 2022. Điều này đẩy cổ phiếu HVN của hãng hàng không này đứng trước nguy cơ bị hủy niêm yết. Trước tình hình trên, HoSE đã nhiều lần có công văn gửi đến Vietnam Airlines lưu ý về điều này. Trên thị trường, cổ phiếu HVN dừng ở mức 13.150 đồng/cp. ', 'Vietjet cho biết, hãng bắt đầu có lãi từ vận chuyển hàng không trong quý 1/2023, Bamboo Airways cũng gần đạt điểm hoà vốn. Hàng không là ngành chịu ảnh hưởng nặng nề do dịch COVID-19, sự hồi phục mặc dù đã được ghi nhận sau khi dịch bệnh được khống chế nhưng phải đến thời điểm này, các hãng hàng không mới ghi nhận lãi trở lại từ vận chuyển hàng không hoặc gần đạt điểm hoà vốn. Thông tin mới nhất về kết quả kinh doanh quý 1/2023, Vietjet (mã JVC) cho biết hãng đã bắt đầu có lãi từ vận chuyển hàng không trong quý 1/2023, dự báo tiếp tục kinh doanh tích cực trong các quý còn lại của năm. Ngay trong những ngày đầu năm, Vietjet chào đón thành viên mới A330 – tàu bay thân rộng về với đội tàu bay của hãng. Đến ngày 8/4, Vietjet khai trương đường bay kết nối giữa TP HCM – Melbourne (Úc) bằng tàu bay A330, chính thức chinh phục các đường bay thương mại xuyên lục địa. Trong tháng 4 và tháng 6 tới, Vietjet cũng cho biết sẽ tiếp tục khai trương các đường bay từ TP HCM tới 2 thành phố khác của Úc là Sydney và Brisbane. Đối với thị trường trong nước, Vietjet sẽ khai trương đường bay Cần Thơ - Vân Đồn (Quảng Ninh), kết nối hai khu vực kinh tế trọng điểm là đồng bằng sông Cửu Long và đồng bằng sông Hồng. Trước đó, năm 2022, doanh thu hợp nhất của Vietjet đạt hơn 40.141 tỷ đồng, trong đó doanh thu vận tải hàng không đạt 33.077 tỷ đồng, lỗ sau thuế 2.261 tỷ đồng. Ngoài Vietjet, hãng hàng không khác là Bamboo Airways cũng mới đưa ra những thông tin ban đầu về kết quả kinh doanh quý 1. Tại cuộc họp Đại hội đồng cổ đông (ĐHĐCĐ) bất thường ngày 10/4, Chủ tịch HĐQT Bamboo Airways Nguyễn Ngọc Trọng cho biết trong quý 1, Bamboo Airways gần đạt điểm hòa vốn. Theo ông Trọng, nếu đại hội lần này thông qua phương án phát hành cổ phiếu để hoán đổi nợ, tăng vốn, hãng hàng không sẽ tăng thêm 6-8 tàu bay trong năm nay và 10 tàu giai đoạn 2024 - 2026. Qua đó Bamboo sẽ có lãi trong năm 2025 và có thể niêm yết trong năm 2026-2027. Tuy nhiên, kết quả đại hội, kế hoạch tăng vốn của Bamboo Airways đã không được thông qua. Lãnh đạo Bamboo Airways cho biết, sẽ cần thời gian để bổ sung thông tin, hoàn thiện phương án tăng vốn khả thi nhất cho Bamboo Airways. Sau khi hoàn thiện, phương án tăng vốn sẽ được trình ĐHĐCĐ thông qua tại cuộc họp gần nhất. Điều gì xảy ra nếu Vietnam Airlines tiếp tục thua lỗ? Dù chưa có con số chi tiết, tuy nhiên, kết quả kinh doanh của Vietjet trong quý 1/2023 không nằm ngoài dự đoán của các công ty chứng khoán trước đó. Trong báo cáo phát hành vào tháng 9/2022, Công ty chứng khoán Rồng Việt từng đưa ra kỳ vọng rằng Vietjet sẽ bắt đầu báo cáo lợi nhuận dương trong mảng vận tải vào năm 2023 trong khi hãng hàng không cung cấp đầy đủ dịch vụ như Vietnam Airlines (mã HVN) sẽ chỉ bắt đầu ghi nhận lợi nhuận ròng vào năm 2025, chủ yếu do chi phí nhiên liệu cao và cơ sở chi phí tương đối cao. Tương tự, Công ty chứng khoán VNDIRECT dự báo, năm 2023, tăng trưởng khách nội địa của Vietjet có thể đạt 12%, khách quốc tế tăng 223% so với năm 2022 đạt 7,83 triệu khách. Lợi nhuận ròng của Vietjet có thể đạt 3.533 tỷ đồng năm 2023. ""Vietjet là hãng hàng không có tỷ lệ đòn bẩy thấp nhất hiện tại, điều này có thể đảm bảo cho các kế hoạch phát triển đội bay trong tương lai. Do đó, chúng tôi cho rằng Vietjet có nhiều cơ hội để nắm bắt sự phục hồi của ngành hàng không Việt Nam trong thời gian tới"", chuyên gia VNDIRECT cho biết. Thống kê của Cục Hàng không Việt Nam cho thấy, năm 2022, số chuyến bay khai thác của Vietjet ghi nhận mức tăng trưởng lên đến hơn 200%, đạt 115.349 chuyến, chỉ thấp hơn Vietnam Airlines 638 chuyến bay. Đáng chú ý, tỷ lệ chậm chuyến của Vietnam Airlines bất ngờ ""đội sổ"" khi là hãng hàng không có tỷ lệ chậm chuyến cao nhất với 12,5% chuyến bay bị chậm, tương ứng với 14.486 chuyến bay. Trong khi Bamboo Airways, Vietjet đều đánh tiếng về kết quả kinh doanh quý 1/2023, Vietnam Airlines lại là một trong số rất ít doanh nghiệp thậm chí chưa nộp báo cáo tài chính kiểm toán năm 2022 theo quy định của Uỷ ban Chứng khoán Nhà nước (UBCKNN). Vietnam Airlines từng có văn bản xin lùi thời gian nộp báo cáo kiểm toán, nhưng cơ quan quản lý nhà nước đã từ chối đề nghị này của Vietnam Airlines. Trường hợp không có thay đổi quan trọng nào trong báo cáo tài chính năm 2022 có kiểm toán sắp tới, hơn 2,2 tỷ cổ HVN sẽ bị buộc phải rời sàn HoSE theo quy định. Năm 2022, tổng doanh thu của Vietnam Airlines đạt gần 71.000 tỷ đồng, lợi nhuận trước thuế hợp nhất vẫn âm khoảng 10.091 tỷ đồng. Đến hết 31/12/2022, Vietnam Airlines ghi nhận khoản lỗ luỹ kế tăng lên gần 34.200 tỷ đồng. Vốn chủ của hãng âm khoảng 10.200 tỷ, trong khi đầu năm vẫn dương trên 500 tỷ.

Kennedy International Airport (JFK) to Indira Gandhi International Airport (DEL) was met by local law enforcement upon ar`rival in DEL due to a disruption on board,"" said American Airlines, in a statement. At this point, many wonder what the solutions will be, to combat these unruly passengers. Many believe that one could be to limit the amount of alcohol that passengers are allowed to consume. It will be interesting to see if American Airlines will take that initiative, as well. Man on American Airlines flight arrested for urinating on passenger ']",0.0013675464

Austrian plans that by 2028 Boeing, a total of ten 787-9 aircraft (the first of which is delivered in 2024) will have modernized the entire long-haul fleet, currently consisting of aging B777 amp; B767 planes. While positive, the fleet modernization program comes indeed way too late for Austrian Airlines as the carrier still uses the awful Boeing 767 and even the B777\'s show lots of wear and tear. One excellent improvement is that the Do amp;Co Flying Chefs are finally back in the air and can present culinary delights to the passengers. As Austrian previously announced on their Facebook Page, the Flying Chefs returned after a long hiatus, primarily caused by the pandemic. They are back! Our guests can enjoy the return of our FlyingChefs from our cateringpartner DO amp;CO Global in the Business Class longhaul. To celebrate that the FlyingChefs prepared an indulgent Viennese treat for all guests on board. Our crew is thrilled – are you? Having onboard meals in Business Class prepared professionally with care and attention to detail is a huge quality improvement to inflight catering, and this feature was dearly missed by Austrian Airline\'s regulars. Unfortunately, when you hand over the ""kitchen duty"" to common cabin crew members, they can only do so much, no matter what airline we\'re talking about here. Yes, some carriers provide in-depth training to crew members tasked with preparing hot meals for premium-class passengers, but at the end of the day, they aren\'t trained chefs. The ""Flying Chefs"" sent up in the air by Do amp;Co are indeed fully trained and qualified chefs and earn a rather high salary compared to the regular cabin crew, which has previously led to protests by the unions representing flight attendants. As far as the fleet is concerned, Austrian is now going to embark on a five-year modernization program that will see the old aircraft leave the long-haul fleet and be replaced by Boeing 787-900 Dreamliners. Austrian Airlines made an announcement in that respect yesterday. Austrian Airlines\' long-haul fleet will grow from nine to ten aircraft beginning of 2024. By 2028 Boeing 787-9 aircraft will modernise the entire long-haul fleet and the \'Dreamliner\' will significantly contribute to reducing CO2 emissions. The arrival of ten Boeing 787-9 – an aircraft of the newest generation of technology – will spur the modernisation and growth of the Austrian Airlines long-haul fleet. The first \'Dreamliner\' will be landing beginning 2024 in Vienna and will expand the flag carrier\'s fleet to 66 aircraft already during the summer flight schedule 2024. Expected by 2028, nine additional Boeing 787-9 will replace the current long-haul jets of the 777 and 767 family. The \'Dreamliner\' will be transferred gradually from Lufthansa Airlines respectively from existing orders of the Lufthansa Group. This will result in a significant rejuvenation of the Austrian Airlines\' fleet. „With the \'Dreamliner\' Austrian Airlines is taking off to a new era of aircraft and is setting course for growth. The fleet induction of ten Boeing 787-9 in the coming five years shows that we are fit for investments and the future"", says Austrian Airlines CEO Annette Mann. Thanks to innovative technology, less weight, good aerodynamics and modern jet engines the \'Dreamliner\' is considered to be significantly more efficient than preceding models. With 2.5 liter fuel per passenger on a 100 kilometer air route, fuel consumption is reduced up to 20 percent when compared to a Boeing 767. Austrian Airlines COO Francesco Sciortino „With Boeing 787-9 we are bringing one of the most innovative long-haul models on the market to Austrian Airlines. This is a team effort Austrian Airlines can be proud of."" With the aircraft being delivered in the coming five years, it\'s reasonable to assume that Austrian will receive the identical Business Class ""Allergris"" cabin product that Lufthansa amp; SWISS unveiled for their upcoming fleet refit, although nothing formal has been announced concerning that. SWISS new Business Class Lufthansa\'s new Business Class It was about time for Austrian to do something innovative and bring the airline back into the spotlight. They let things slide for too long, and the carrier was losing its polish, becoming a rather lackluster airline after the Flying Chefs were let go, and all they had to offer was old planes with slightly better service than Lufthansa. That the carrier is now aspiring to climb back up is definitely the most positive sign, as I believe they have a lot of potential and I\'d rather fly Austrian Airlines in Business Class than Lufthansa if I have to connect either way. Conclusion Austrian Airlines is bringing back the Flying Chefs (actually already on board and in full work mode) and in the coming five years the airline will improve its long-haul fleet by phasing out the old B767 amp; B777, replacing them with the Boeing 787-900 Dreamliner. Austrian hasn\'t yet revealed the cabin products for these aircraft but it can be assumed that they will receive the Allegris product that has been chosen for Lufthansa amp; SWISS to harmonize the product experience within the LH Group.

A spokesperson told FOX Business the airline is not providing a breakdown of the hiring at this time. In early February, Spirit Airlines reported that its workforce at the end of 2022 totaled roughly 12,000 active employees, of which almost 3,200 were pilots, about 5,700 were flight attendants and some 3,100 were workers in other roles, according to its annual report.

So, he was able to grab the bag and take it on the plane with him He continued on to say he asked an attendant for a bandage for a cut when he got on the plane, but claimed that the attendant told him no. He later got a bandage from a different attendant. Once he landed, Cole claimed that he waited ""20 or 30 minutes"" at a baggage carousel to get the luggage he checked. After noticing that the information desk was closed, he said that he finally got to talk to a TSA person, who told him ""Oh yeah, Frontier doesn\'t have a carousel right now."" Cole said that the TSA worker told him that ""normally an attendant would come down"" and show passengers where their bags are. Instead of waiting, Cole decided to go home and return to the airport the next morning for his bag Upon returning the next day, Cole said his luggage was not in the airport\'s baggage room so he had to ""file a claim"" about the missing bag. An airline worker also apparently told him that they couldn\'t track his bag Cole said that he filed another claim with a Frontier bot before he was then transferred to ""a human.""""So I was like, \'Hey, I\'m sorry I\'m being short with you. I\'m not mad at you. I just can\'t believe how helpless I feel right now. Because there\'s literally not one outlet that has offered me any substance of information about where my bag is,"" he explained of the ordeal In a follow up video, Cole shared an update on the situation and revealed that he did get his bag back moer than 48 hours after he landed. He said that after the employees called him to say that his bag would be delivered, he got another call from Frontier about the person dropping it off.""He\'s like \'Hey, so just wanted to give you an update on your bag. One of our Frontier drivers is in the hospital, so I got it so far, but my grandfather is actually going to drive it down to you,\'"" Cole recalled. ""And I was like, \'Okay that\'s fine\'...but it seems weird that his grandfather would give it to me, but at this point I didn\'t think I was going to get my bag.""Cole then recalled that the grandfather had driven to the wrong town in Connecticut, which was ""three hours north"" from where the traveller lived. Still, the worker\'s grandfather drove to his house and dropped the luggage off.""He drove a bunch of extra time, this guy\'s grandfather apparently, which is like so crazy,"" he added. ""I cannot believe that this Frontier employee was in a position where he was going to have his grandfather drive it.""As of 7 April, Cole\'s two videos have more than 539,200 views. Many TikTok users in the comments have been criticising Frontier.""Honestly I feel like budget airlines in the end just cost more money and hassle,"" one wrote.""Frontier you can\'t have your bag on board with you, but also you can\'t have it after you land. Good luck,"" another added ']",0.041217998

An on-time performance report released last week by analytics company Cirium looked at which airlines in several regions around the globe are delivering on their promise to get passengers to their destinations on time. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the only two Canadian airlines listed in the report had pretty low stats for their on-time arrivals. Out of 10 North American airlines, Air Canada and WestJet were found to be the worst for delays, with WestJet seeing only 63.23% of its flights arrive on time, while Air Canada fared even worse at 56.71%. In fact, out of all the airlines mentioned — covering several different regions and categories, including Europe, Latin America, and low-cost airlines — Air Canada and WestJet had the lowest on-time arrival percentage. This is not new for the airlines, either. While the report looked at the airlines' stats for February 2023, the two fared about the same way in January and were also ranked the worst for punctuality in 2022. On the other end of the spectrum, some airlines were ranked as being the best for arriving on time, so you may want to explore your options when booking a trip. Globally, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines was found to be the most on-time carrier, with 89.66% of its flights arriving as scheduled. Following it was Spanish airline Iberia (89.57%) and Colombian airline Avianca (87.89%). In North America, U.S. carrier Delta Airlines was found to be the most punctual, with 84.82% of flights arriving on time, followed by Southwest (82.43%) and American Airlines (81.63%). So, when possible, you may want to opt to fly with one of these carriers instead. If you do end up on a delayed flight in Canada, it's important to know your rights as a traveller. According to the Canadian Transportation Agency, when an airline delays or cancels a flight, what passengers may be entitled to depends on the level of control the airline has over the reason for the delay or cancellation. Flight compensation varies according to the scenario, but in some cases, travellers can get 1,000 as compensation for a delayed or cancelled flight.

Source Wikimedia Commons Affected routes include between Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan, Tawau and Kuching, as well as between Kuching and Miri, says the group. Firefly will operate daily flights on the four routes, an up-gauge in capacity compared to Malaysia Airlines, which only only flies between two and five times a week with 737s.

This is especially true on international flights and at domestic ""slot-controlled"" airports where the F.A.A. has imposed limits on takeoffs. That said, all delays are not created equal. Mr. Acharya passed along some useful tricks he uses when traveling to better guess when a delay is going to stick, or even ""creep"" forward, to use frustratingly accurate airline lingo. First, he figures out where the aircraft is. If it\'s already at the gate, the delay might not stick if a mechanical issue can be solved faster than projected or crew members stuck in traffic arrive faster than they expected. If the plane is not at the gate, that could indicate a more definitive or even creeping delay. Check online or ask staff where the incoming aircraft is; if it\'s still hours away, that\'s a bad sign. On the other hand, if you\'re at an airport that serves as the hub of the airline you\'re flying (Fort Lauderdale, Fla., for example, for Spirit) they might be able to switch equipment or swap crews more easily.

You can reach him at zwichter@usatoday.com Facebook Twitter Email "", 'How To Find The Best Travel Deal, Flight Deals amp; Error Fares Frontier Airline Deals I signed up for several flights email alerts, so as soon as the Frontier deal alert came through for 14 tickets, I purchased the tickets immediately without wasting time. Most of these deals sell out quickly so it is essential to make sure you purchase tickets as soon as you get the email alert. The tickets for our Frontier Airlines flight were exactly 14 each including taxes and I purchased directly on the Frontier Airlines flight website. You can see below that one way tickets for all 6 of costs 85.20. We basically only paid for the taxes when flying Frontier Airlines. That is the equivalent of a full tank of gas in my car for a local road trip, so I was pretty excited about this deal! Where Have We Traveled To On Frontier Airlines We love taking Frontier Airline Flights, and below are a list of all the cool places we\'ve been to. Chicago Denver Orlando in the Spring – we visited Disney too Orlando in the Summer Dominican Republic Tips When Flying Frontier Airlines Frontier Airlines Check In You can check in for your Frontier flight online or on the Frontier check in portion of the mobile app 24 hours prior to departure. If you plan to do a Frontier check in which includes luggage, then you can purchase your luggage online prior to your flight and then check in at the Frontier Airlines counter and pay the luggage fees. The Frontier check in process is very easy and simple. Frontier offer online, check in through the app or in-person check in. When completing your Frontier check in online or via the Frontier mobile app, you can purchase a seat assignment, priority boarding, luggage and more at that time. We usually check in via the Frontier mobile app and I don\'t purchase any extras. Their mobile check in makes traveling with Frontier so easy. Frontier Airlines Flight Seat Assignment This airline charges between 10- 20 to select each seat, so I skipped this step when I was purchasing our tickets. If I had to choose our seats, our tickets would have doubled in price and my goal was not to pay a dime over 14. A lot of people worry about this especially when traveling with children and I can understand why. There have been times that children have been assigned separate seats from their parents on flights, and that can be problematic especially with young children. In such an instance, I don\'t expect people to move so that I can sit by my kids, especially as those people may have paid to choose seats and it is very unfair. However, I was not worried, and took the risk by not investing further in seat selection. We were lucky enough to all be assigned seats right next to each other when flying Frontier Airlines. Traveling with kids and looking for tips, then make sure to click the links below and Best Travel Gear For KidsHow To Travel With Kids Internationally AloneBest Countries To Visit In The World With KidsTop Must Have Items When Traveling With KidsHow To Keep Your Kids Entertained amp; Happy On FlightsEverything You Need To Know About Traveling With A Car Seat Frontier Airlines Baggage Policy If you plan to travel on a Frontier Airlines flight with baggage, you will be charged 30 to take carry-on luggage on board (less than 35 pounds) and 25 to check in luggage. If you don\'t pay the required Frontier baggage fee beforehand, or your bag is bigger than a personal item bag, then you be charged 60 at the gate when flying Frontier Airlines. And, if you have a bag weighing more like 50 pounds or 100 pounds, you will surely pay an additional fee or be required to check your bag. You have access to a free Frontier Airlines baggage which is a free personal item bag sized 18inX8inX4in (about the size of a diaper bag) per paying passenger. I didn\'t want to pay a dime for luggage, so I went on the hunt for a personal item approved luggage for myself. For the kids, it was easy as they use these Osprey 1 and Osprey 2 backpacks which fit the personal item dimensions with ease. I love that all our bags were free of charge. I searched online for a while, reading lots of reviews about Frontier Airlines baggage and the discount den, and finally settled on the Boarding Blue Personal Item (By the way, it works for Spirit Airlines, American Airlines, United Airlines etc). In the end, I was able to pack for 5 days in Orlando in just a personal item sized bag which fits the Frontier Airline baggage requirements. My husband and I used packing cubes and it made packing so much easier. If you don\'t own packing cubes then please invest in them now. It\'ll make packing your Frontier Airlines baggage so much easier. Note You can also opt for the Works Bundle or Perks Bundle as well, which include both seats and baggage. Keep in mind your personal item will have to be stored under your seat, and not in the overhead bin. Frontier Airlines Car Seat and Stroller Policy When flying Frontier airlines, you are allowed free check-in of a stroller and/or car seat. We didn\'t travel with a stroller, but we did take the kids car seats. The kids used the GoGo Babyz and EvenFlo Maestro Car Seat, and they were able to pull their own car seats around the airport with ease. We also traveled with their scooters and we were able to check everything in at the gate. We used a Car Seat Gate Check Bag and put the car seat, gogo babyz travel mate and their scooter inside the bag. All their bags were at the gate in Florida when we got off our flight in Florida. We have also taken the Safety First My Guide on a previous Frontier flight and Aiden rode in his car seat on the flight. So, you have the option to do that too if you want to. If your kiddos are past the car seat stage, Frontier also allows parents to use booster seats during the flight. Just not during take-off and landing. Comfort On A Frontier Airlines Flight The seats on Frontier Airlines do not recline, so keep this in mind for long flights just in case you have a bad back and absolutely need to recline your seat. However, the seats are spacious and we had no issues with leg room. The seat back tray is really small, but It didn\'t matter much to us because we didn\'t really use it. Frontier does not have first class or comfort seating. We had a red eye flight and they didn\'t have any blankets on the flight, so make sure to pack something for the kids to cover themselves with when flying Frontier Airlines. I also pack a light blanket when I travel, but mistakenly checked it with the car seats so the kids used their jackets as pillows and my jacket to cover themselves. Also, a neck pillow is must for comfort. I use the TRTL neck pillow which is basically like a neck brace, and let me tell you something, It WORKS! Frontier Airlines In Flight Service Frontier Airlines charges for everything on their flight, except water. It\'s also important to note that they also only accept credit cards and debit cards for snacks, no cash. I packed snacks and food for the kids to eat, so we were able to fly without me purchasing anything on our flight. I didn\'t know they offered water for free, so I packed an empty water bottled and refilled it at the airport prior to our flight. Most airports I have been to have water filling stations which I love. When packing a water bottle for kids make sure to get one that doesn\'t have a straw as the air pressure will make it spill when you open it; lesson learned here. We also use these snack bowls and each kids gets their own. Frontier Airlines Flight Entertainment Frontier Airlines does not offer any in-flight entertainment and also their flights also do not have internet. Make sure to plan accordingly especially when flying Frontier Airlines with kids. Make sure you have enough to keep them busy to make for a smooth flight. If your kids have a tablet, make sure to download apps that work offline, and TV shows etc. If you are flying without a tablet, make sure to load up on toys for the kids. Make sure to reach my post on ""How To Keep Your Kids Entertained On Flights"" for all the tips you need. We had a red eye flight so the kids slept the entire flight. Frontier Airlines Customer Service We had no issues whatsoever with customer service on Frontier Airlines. When we got to the gate, the gate agent helped us bag the kids car seats and scooters so that we could gate check it. The flight attendants were jovial and nice and very responsive when flying Frontier Airlines. I turned on my call light because I needed water and they were there right away with water.

88,87,16,87_turkish_class_istanbul_business class,"['turkish', 'class', 'istanbul', 'business class', 'stopover', 'hotel', '4star', 'lounge', 'best', 'business']","['TRIP REPORT Turkish Airlines, Belgrade - Istanbul TRIP REPORTI\'m generally a great fan of Turkish Airlines but must admit that over the years, ours has been a rather love-love-less (not hate) relationship. I still greatly applaud and admire TK for their onboard service generosity - versus pretty much everyone else in Europe and even further afield, yet their flights overall can be a starkly contrasting experience in many other areas (especially in service consistency and attention to detail that I will elaborate about a bit later), often carelessly spoiling an otherwise excellent onboard product offering On this particular journey, I flew from Belgrade to Istanbul on TK 1084 in Business Class, connecting on to an Asian destination that I was too tired to cover in this trip report Turkish Airlines\' 4-year-old Boeing 737 MAX 8 - TC-LCNAn uneventful and very quick check-in at Terminal 1 in Belgrade with no queue in the Business Class lane was followed by a visit to a beehive that was the Air Serbia Lounge at this time of the day - almost all seats were fully occupied with friendly staff in attendance. Fashionably late in arrival, my rather packed Boeing 737 MAX8 provided a delayed departure as well but still a welcoming atmosphere with a clean cabin and warm entrance greetings offered by a young cabin crew team. TK\'s Business Class is no flydubai but offers decent recline and a large IFE screens. While more than acceptable for short to medium haul flights, with their MAX\'s operating sectors of up to 7 hours, I guess that this particular J Class seat could end up being a bit uncomfortable and disappointing on such long narrowbody journeys Multiple IFE screens on Turkish Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8What struck me was TK\'s absolute love for TV screens onboard, they literally litter the cabin and were all over the place – felt like a NASA control room especially once the lights were dimmed for take-off. A nice choice of fresh, non-alcoholic fruit drinks was offered pre-departure, together with a mind-blowing menu for this 1 30h flight (tastily made by Do amp;Co… probably the best airline catering company in the world) Turkish Airlines narrowbody Business Class seatOur rather bumpy, spring and pre-snowstorm departure from Belgrade resulted in the crew remaining (understandably) seated for much longer than usual. Once their ""all-clear"" was given from the cockpit, they sprung into action, delivering pre-set trays and previously noted drinks across the Business Class cabin. The tray served, as mentioned earlier, was overwhelming and the quantity of food was simply enormous. Quality was top notch The menuI must say that I\'m no fan of lamb, but I did give it a try before abandoning it altogether… the rest of the tray food contents was truly fresh and absolutely delicious TK Business Class mealRegarding the attention to detail remark I made earlier, I noticed that this is one of TK\'s weaknesses and witnessed in different forms on numerous prior occasions. For example, the IFE on my flight showed that I was flying on a Boeing 737-800, the map clearly displaying an image of an Airbus A321neo while I was seated on a Boeing 737 MAX 8. On my onward journey from Istanbul, Turkish Airlines ""informed me"" that Belgrade has been renamed to Marseille; Athens was now Nouakchott while Antalya swapped places with Ho Chi Ming City. Chicago, Riga and Kabul also managed to migrate to new and rather peculiar locations. These kinds of omissions and mistakes, while not tragic, are still noticeable and caused quite a few giggles all around Turkish Airlines ""chaotic"" Flying MapsThe rest of the flight was really nothing worth commenting further; comfortable and enjoyable in a mood-lit cabin.

95,94,15,94_bookings_bank_valley bank_silicon valley bank,"['bookings', 'bank', 'valley bank', 'silicon valley bank', 'silicon valley', 'silicon', 'higher', 'valley', 'kirby', 'businesstravel']","['After Silicon Valley Bank failed last month and raised fears about a wider banking crisis, bookings for last-minute business trips on United Airlines quickly dropped and remained depressed for about two weeks, underscoring how economic turmoil could choke off a strong run for the travel industry United CEO Scott Kirby said Wednesday that business-travel bookings have since recovered, but the lesson was not lost. ""It seems clear that the macro risks are higher today than they were even a few months ago,"" Kirby said. He said United still expects a mild recession, ""which is consistent with what we are currently seeing in our bookings, but we agree the tail risk is higher than normal. Kirby said he still feels good about United\'s forecast for full-year profit — which is higher than Wall Street expects. However, his remarks on a call with analysts exposed a crack in the airline industry\'s otherwise solid front of rosy commentary about travel demand. Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian told The Associated Press last week that his airline saw no impact from the bank failures and other dire headlines. Consumers might be reducing their spending on cars and home-improvement projects, he said, ""but they are certainly not pulling back on air travel."" Airline ticket sales have surged since early last year despite rising fares, high inflation, fear of recession, layoffs in the tech sector, and the failures of Silicon Valley Bank in California and Signature Bank in New York. Even with corporate travel still lagging, the number of people going through U.S. airports was higher in January and February than in the same months of 2019, before the pandemic. March and the first half of April were barely below 2019 levels, according to government figures. Airlines are counting on that strong demand continuing and helping them become profitable in the April-through-June quarter, which includes the start of the critical summer travel season. Delta lost 363 million and United lost 194 million in the first quarter. It\'s traditionally the weakest travel period of the year, and both airlines had higher labor and fuel costs that offset huge revenue gains. United predicted after the market closed Tuesday that it will earn up to 4 per share in the April-through-June period, which is more than analysts were expecting. The shares rose 6% in afternoon trading and helped lift other airline stocks. Consumers appear to be especially interested in international trips this summer, with bookings rising much faster than for domestic flights. United plans to offer fewer domestic flights in the second quarter than it did in the first. Business-travel bookings are running ahead of last year\'s pace, but they fell 8% compared with 2019 after the March failure of Silicon Valley Bank, said Andrew Nocella, United\'s chief commercial officer.

Airline ticket sales have surged since early last year despite rising fares, high inflation, fear of recession, layoffs in the tech sector, and the failures of Silicon Valley Bank in California and Signature Bank in New York. Even with corporate travel still lagging, the number of people going through U.S. airports was higher in January and February than in the same months of 2019, before the pandemic. March and the first half of April were barely below 2019 levels, according to government figures. Airlines are counting on that strong demand continuing and helping them become profitable in the April-through-June quarter, which includes the start of the critical summer travel season. Delta lost 363 million and United lost 194 million in the first quarter. It\'s traditionally the weakest travel period of the year, and both airlines had higher labor and fuel costs that offset huge revenue gains. United predicted after the market closed Tuesday that it will earn up to 4 per share in the April-through-June period, which is more than analysts were expecting.

The Government Accountability Office also said airlines are taking longer to recover from disruptions such as storms. Surges in cancellations in late 2021 and early 2022 lasted longer than they did before the pandemic, the GAO said. Much of the increase in airline-caused cancellations has occurred at budget airlines, but the largest carriers have also made more unforced errors, according to government data. Airlines have clashed with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg over blame for high rates of canceled and delayed flights in the past two years. Airlines argue that the government is at fault for not having enough air traffic controllers, while Buttigieg has blamed the carriers. The GAO report was requested by Republican leaders of the House Transportation Committee. The GAO said it examined flight data from January 2018 through April 2022 to understand why travelers suffered more delays and cancellations as travel began to recover from the pandemic. Rows of baggage carts could be seen on the tarmac at Dallas Love Field Airport on Tuesday. The GAO said weather was the leading cause of cancellations in the two years before the pandemic, but the percentage of airline-caused cancellations began increasing in early 2021. From October through December 2021, airlines caused 60% or more of cancellations — higher that at any time in 2018 or 2019. U.S. amp; World The day\'s top national and international news. At the time, airlines were understaffed. The airlines took 54 billion in taxpayer money to keep employees on the job through the pandemic, but they reduced workers anyway by paying them incentives to quit. As travel rebounded, the airlines struggled to replace thousands of departed workers. They now have more workers than in 2019 — and the cancellation rate this year is lower than during the same period in 2019, according to data from tracking service FlightAware. A spokeswoman for trade group Airlines for America said the majority of cancellations this year have been caused by severe weather and air traffic control outages – about 1,300 flights were canceled in one day because of an outage in a Federal Aviation Administration safety-alerting system. ""Carriers have taken responsibility for challenges within their control and continue working diligently to improve operational reliability as demand for air travel rapidly returns,"" said the spokeswoman, Hannah Walden. ""This includes launching aggressive, successful hiring campaigns for positions across the industry and reducing schedules in response to the FAA\'s staffing shortages."" Several airlines agreed to reduce schedules in New York this summer at the request of the FAA, which has a severe shortage of controllers at a key facility on Long Island. In 2019, Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines had the highest percentages of airline-caused cancellations, easily topping 50%. In late 2021, they were joined by low-fare carriers Allegiant Air, Spirit Airlines, JetBlue Airways and Frontier, each of whom were responsible for 60% or more of their cancellations, according to GAO. The percentage of cancellations caused by the airline also increased at Southwest, Delta, American and United. The figures did not include the 16,700 late-December cancellations at Southwest that followed the breakdown of the airline\'s crew-rescheduling system. The GAO said the Transportation Department has increased its oversight of airline-scheduling practices. The Transportation and Justice departments are investigating whether Southwest scheduled more flights than it could handle before last December\'s meltdown. The Southwest debacle has led to calls to strengthen passenger-compensation rules. ', '""So I thought, what if I bought a van and renovated it?"" He kept the van in the airport parking lots and ended up sleeping in it to save hotel money whenever he went to work, he added. This became his arrangement for the next couple of years. But everything changed when the pandemic struck. As the entire aviation industry ground to a halt, Pankey felt it was time to rethink his lifestyle and his goals. The exterior of the aircraft box truck before it was converted Mark Pankey During that period, pilots were being told to take time off with partial pay, so Pankey decided to put his plan of building a house on hold. ""If COVID-19 can shut down the world, maybe it\'s not a good idea to go into debt right now and build a big old house,"" Pankey said. He had enjoyed the process of renovating his van and decided he wanted to do it again — but on a bigger scale. ""I had seen these box trucks at work, and I thought about how cool would it be to live in one of those, or to build one out,"" he said. ""I was telling another pilot this, and sometime later he sent me a text saying that a whole bunch of them were being auctioned off in Seattle."" Pankey ended up buying one of the former Southwest Airlines catering trucks for 3,300 in the auction. The interiors of the former aircraft catering truck before Pankey renovated it Mark Pankey Insider verified the cost of the vehicle with online records. The vehicle comes with a scissor lift that is used to raise the box-shaped cargo space on its back until it is level with the plane, Pankey said. Items such as food and beverages can then be loaded onto the aircraft with ease. ""It actually spent a lot of time in Las Vegas, and then they moved it up to Seattle,"" he said. ""It\'s about 20 years old."" The truck came almost empty, with a few shelves that Pankey had to clear out. ""I was starting the project from scratch,"" he said. One of the first things that Pankey did was rebuild the roof The truck originally came with a flat roof, but he wanted something with a slope. The truck originally had a flat roof, but Pankey rebuilt it and turned it into a sloped roof Mark Pankey Pankey created a frame for the new roof by welding metal beams together and extended one side of the roof by an extra two feet. ""I wanted a slanted roof just so I could collect rainwater on one side, and I wanted to make it taller as well, so I had a little bit more room,"" Pankey said. Having a sloped roof also meant that any solar panels that he placed on top of it would already be at an angle towards the sun, he said. Moreover, the original roof on the truck was made out of fiberglass and felt a little flimsy, Pankey said ""They\'re super thin — like you could probably put your hand through it if you punched it with your fist."" Pankey said it took about a week for him to completely cover the truck\'s interiors with spray foam insulation. Insulating the walls of the aircraft catering truck took Pankey about a week of work Mark Pankey ""When I finally got that thing completely sprayed, it was just a huge load off my shoulders,"" Pankey said. The insulation wasn\'t just keeping the inside of the truck warm, it was good for soundproofing too, he said ""It was so quiet in there. Even if I was running a power tool on the inside, you couldn\'t hear anything from the outside."" ""One of my neighbors used to bring over his amp and his guitar, and he would sing in it. It was really loud before the foam, and after you couldn\'t even hear it at all,"" he added. Pankey worked on his tiny home while it was parked outside of his Colorado apartment complex. He built everything on his own — including the floors, the walls, and the cabinets. Pankey built the cabinets inside the tiny home on his own Mark Pankey Although some neighbors were a bit apprehensive about his decision to work right outside of the apartments, most of them were just as excited about the project as he was, Pankey said. ""They loved it. They would come over every day and cheer me on,"" he added. ""Or they\'d want to go up and down in it, so I\'d run it up and down for them."" The original truck had a white exterior, but Pankey painted it grey to resemble the fighter planes that he used to fly back when he was in the Air Force. Inspired by the car in the 1977 action comedy ""Smokey and the Bandit,"" Pankey even spray-painted a bird on the hood of his truck Mark Pankey ""I also painted some rivets all over it so it would look even more like an airplane,"" Pankey said. The hood of the truck features a spray-painted bird motif that was inspired by the car in the 1977 action comedy film ""Smokey and the Bandit."" Pankey started renovating his truck in April 2020 and completed the project seven months later in November. He named the vehicle ""SnakPak."" Mark Pankey sitting on the hood of his converted aircraft box truck tiny home Mark Pankey He estimates that he spent between 30,000 and 35,000 on the build, including the cost of buying the truck. The converted vehicle still retains the original side banner from its days as an airline catering truck, with a cheeky slogan that reads ""The snacks are on me."" ""I was hoping they would let me keep it,"" Pankey said. ""I was talking to my friends before the auction, and they all thought that the truck was amazing and fitting because I\'m a pilot and I work for Southwest Airlines."" Although the company\'s name and heart logo had to be removed in the end, he was allowed to keep the banner. The scissor lift on the truck is still functional and can be raised to a maximum height of 17 feet, although Pankey very rarely gets it up that high. The scissor lift goes up to a maximum height of 17 feet Mark Pankey Pankey usually raises the scissor lift about five or six feet up when he\'s parked, just so that it\'s level with the front deck. ""It\'s easier to get out on the front deck that way. When the box is down, I have to climb up to get out onto the deck where I cook and eat,"" he said. While being raised up in the air gives him unblocked views of the surroundings, it also means that he needs to watch his step. ""I\'ve come close to walking off the edge of it,"" Pankey said. ""I have a little lanyard flag, it\'s orange, and it says, \'Remove before flight.\' I hang that up so that I would walk into it when I have the door shut, and remember that the truck is up."" The box section of the truck is about 14 feet long. The loft and some storage cabinets are on one end, while the middle section is occupied by a kitchen countertop. The sleeping loft and some storage cabinets occupy one end of the box section Mark Pankey The loft is where Pankey sleeps, and it fits a queen-sized mattress. ""I have a foldable, telescoping ladder that I open up and use,"" Pankey said. ""In retrospect, I should have planned this better and built a ladder for me to get up."" The other end of the box section is where the composting toilet and shower cubicle is. The other end of the box section is where the composting toilet and shower cubicle is Mark Pankey Instead of using the narrow shower cubicles that are typical of RV homes, Pankey opted for an in-home, corner-style shower made from tempered glass. Although he was initially apprehensive about how it would hold up while he was on the road, the structure is surprisingly sturdy, Pankey said. Pankey uses a mix of wires and magnets to keep his things anchored while he\'s on the road. The shelves that Pankey built Mark Pankey Pankey glued magnets to the base of his kitchenware to ensure they stay on the shelves when the journey gets bumpy. For larger items like jars and containers, he strings heavy-duty cords across the entire shelf to prevent them from falling out. Pankey covered the outdoor deck with artificial turf to resemble a mini backyard. The outdoor deck and kitchen Mark Pankey Apart from a small table where Pankey eats his meals, the deck is also where he keeps his outdoor grill and stove. There\'s an outdoor showerhead and a mini platform at the back of the truck. There\'s an outdoor shower at the back of the truck Mark Pankey The logs covering the back of the truck are for aesthetic purposes, Pankey said. ""I dropped by an old timber mill on my way to get supplies at Home Depot, just to see if they had any scraps. Sure enough, they did — they had a whole bunch of those so I just took them,"" he said. Pankey\'s electricity comes from solar panels that he installed on the roof. The truck also has a water tank that he can either fill up with rainwater or at truck stops. An aerial view of the solar panels on the top of the aircraft catering truck Mark Pankey ""If I\'m somewhere where it\'s raining, I collect the rainwater. If it doesn\'t rain, I have a water bladder that I\'ll fill up and bring back,"" Pankey said. In addition, the truck is equipped with a plug that allows him to hook up to utilities at campgrounds and RV parks, he added. The sides of the aircraft catering truck are lined with old snowboards and skis that Pankey cut to fit around his windows. The sides of the aircraft catering truck are lined with snowboards, while the back is covered in logs Mark Pankey ""Those are downhill skis and a couple of snowboards,"" Pankey said. ""I haven\'t done a whole lot of skiing since I\'ve been living in this, but I used to ski all the time."" Pankey has been living full-time in the converted aircraft catering truck for over two years. He has since sold his Colorado apartment and land. Pankey uses the catering truck to tow his Tacoma pickup Mark Pankey Pankey also has a Toyota Tacoma pickup, that he tows with the aircraft catering truck. He says that this helps when it comes to running errands around town. Looking back at his experience, Pankey says that adapting to the tiny home wasn\'t all that difficult due to his previous experience living in the van. ""I didn\'t have a whole lot of room in the van, so when I got into this thing, it was massive,"" Pankey said. But at the same time, he acknowledges how such a drastic lifestyle change can be a nerve-racking experience. ""When you move out of a house or an apartment into something like this full-time, there\'s definitely anxiety when you do it,"" he added. ', ""800 a month, he said.

The original truck had a white exterior, but Pankey painted it grey to resemble the fighter planes that he used to fly back when he was in the Air Force. Inspired by the car in the 1977 action comedy Smokey and the Bandit, Pankey even spray-painted a bird on the hood of his truck. Mark Pankey I also painted some rivets all over it so it would look even more like an airplane, Pankey said. The hood of the truck features a spray-painted bird motif that was inspired by the car in the 1977 action comedy film Smokey and the Bandit. Pankey started renovating his truck in April 2020 and completed the project seven months later in November. He named the vehicle SnakPak. Mark Pankey sitting on the hood of his converted aircraft box truck tiny home. Mark Pankey He estimates that he spent between 30,000 and 35,000 on the build, including the cost of buying the truck. The converted vehicle still retains the original side banner from its days as an airline catering truck, with a cheeky slogan that reads The snacks are on me. I was hoping they would let me keep it, Pankey said. I was talking to my friends before the auction, and they all thought that the truck was amazing and fitting because I'm a pilot and I work for Southwest Airlines. Although the company's name and heart logo had to be removed in the end, he was allowed to keep the banner. The scissor lift on the truck is still functional and can be raised to a maximum height of 17 feet, although Pankey very rarely gets it up that high. The scissor lift goes up to a maximum height of 17 feet. Mark Pankey Pankey usually raises the scissor lift about five or six feet up when he's parked, just so that it's level with the front deck. It's easier to get out on the front deck that way. When the box is down, I have to climb up to get out onto the deck where I cook and eat, he said. While being raised up in the air gives him unblocked views of the surroundings, it also means that he needs to watch his step. I've come close to walking off the edge of it, Pankey said. I have a little lanyard flag, it's orange, and it says, 'Remove before flight.' I hang that up so that I would walk into it when I have the door shut, and remember that the truck is up. The box section of the truck is about 14 feet long. The loft and some storage cabinets are on one end, while the middle section is occupied by a kitchen countertop. The sleeping loft and some storage cabinets occupy one end of the box section. Mark Pankey The loft is where Pankey sleeps, and it fits a queen-sized mattress. I have a foldable, telescoping ladder that I open up and use, Pankey said. In retrospect, I should have planned this better and built a ladder for me to get up. The other end of the box section is where the composting toilet and shower cubicle is. The other end of the box section is where the composting toilet and shower cubicle is. Mark Pankey Instead of using the narrow shower cubicles that are typical of RV homes, Pankey opted for an in-home, corner-style shower made from tempered glass. Although he was initially apprehensive about how it would hold up while he was on the road, the structure is surprisingly sturdy, Pankey said. Pankey uses a mix of wires and magnets to keep his things anchored while he's on the road. The shelves that Pankey built. Mark Pankey Pankey glued magnets to the base of his kitchenware to ensure they stay on the shelves when the journey gets bumpy. For larger items like jars and containers, he strings heavy-duty cords across the entire shelf to prevent them from falling out. Pankey covered the outdoor deck with artificial turf to resemble a mini backyard. The outdoor deck and kitchen. Mark Pankey Apart from a small table where Pankey eats his meals, the deck is also where he keeps his outdoor grill and stove. There's an outdoor showerhead and a mini platform at the back of the truck. There's an outdoor shower at the back of the truck. Mark Pankey The logs covering the back of the truck are for aesthetic purposes, Pankey said. I dropped by an old timber mill on my way to get supplies at Home Depot, just to see if they had any scraps. Sure enough, they did — they had a whole bunch of those so I just took them, he said. Pankey's electricity comes from solar panels that he installed on the roof. The truck also has a water tank that he can either fill up with rainwater or at truck stops. An aerial view of the solar panels on the top of the aircraft catering truck. Mark Pankey If I'm somewhere where it's raining, I collect the rainwater. If it doesn't rain, I have a water bladder that I'll fill up and bring back, Pankey said. In addition, the truck is equipped with a plug that allows him to hook up to utilities at campgrounds and RV parks, he added. The sides of the aircraft catering truck are lined with old snowboards and skis that Pankey cut to fit around his windows. The sides of the aircraft catering truck are lined with snowboards, while the back is covered in logs. Mark Pankey Those are downhill skis and a couple of snowboards, Pankey said. I haven't done a whole lot of skiing since I've been living in this, but I used to ski all the time. Pankey has been living full-time in the converted aircraft catering truck for over two years. He has since sold his Colorado apartment and land. Pankey uses the catering truck to tow his Tacoma pickup. Mark Pankey Pankey also has a Toyota Tacoma pickup, that he tows with the aircraft catering truck. He says that this helps when it comes to running errands around town. Looking back at his experience, Pankey says that adapting to the tiny home wasn't all that difficult due to his previous experience living in the van. I didn't have a whole lot of room in the van, so when I got into this thing, it was massive, Pankey said. But at the same time, he acknowledges how such a drastic lifestyle change can be a nerve-racking experience. When you move out of a house or an apartment into something like this full-time, there's definitely anxiety when you do it, he added. But I was ready to do it, you know? I told myself I'm going to make it happen and it's going to be fun. Pankey has some advice for others who are looking to do the same as him ""]",0.50009644

United has also said it expects to have more premium seats for sale for each departure than any other airline in North America by 2026 as travelers compete for what can be elusive upgrades and the ranks of elite travelers with piles of frequent flyer points swell. United\'s Nocella said last week that the carrier will have multiple production lines revamping the interiors of the narrow-body planes this summer, helping to pick up the pace. The carrier expects about one in three aircraft in its narrow-body fleet, including new aircraft, will have the upgraded interior by the end of the year. ""It will just take a little bit longer than we had originally intended,"" he said. A United Airbus A319 was recently modified and should be flying soon, he added. The airline had targeted 2025 to complete the narrow-body upgrades, but it\'s unclear if United will make that goal. Separately, United said that all of its wide-body aircraft will be outfitted with premium economy seats and its Polaris seats, the carrier\'s top-tier class on international and other long-haul flights, by August. Other airlines like JetBlue and Delta Air Lines have also added amenities on their planes in recent years, upgrading their top-tier classes, installing new seats and adding some services, including free Wi-Fi. Delta executives have said that revenue growth for premium seats like business class or premium economy has outpaced sales from standard coach. ""We see high stickiness to those products,"" Glen Hauenstein, Delta\'s president, said on the company\'s quarterly call earlier this month. ""So once you start flying in those cabins, you tend not to go back."" ', 'United Airlines Seatbacks Courtesy United Airlines United Airlines\' plan to revamp the cabins on its older narrow-body planes is running behind schedule because of supply chain strains, the carrier told CNBC this week. The upgrades include bigger premium cabins, seat-back entertainment screens throughout the planes, Bluetooth capabilities and other amenities. The Chicago-based airline previously expected to have 100 of its narrow-body planes retrofitted with the new interiors by the end of the year but now expects 60 will be complete by then, a spokeswoman said.

Abang Johari said he had suggested to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim on the possibility of using a big helicopter that can accommodate up to 20 passengers to serve the rural routes that are subsidised by the government. He explained this could save costs in building airports and also in maintaining aircraft such as the Twin Otter. ""Now there is a new helicopter that can accommodate 20 passengers, why you have to use the old Twin Otter, then you don\'t have to build airport, and then you can access to all the rural kampung and can bring cargo (as well) ""I told (this to) the PM last week. I think the people in aviation has to go outside the box. It is not like before when there was no big helicopter. ""Now there is such helicopter. And now you got saving from the (doing the runway for the) airport,"" he told the media at his Hari Raya Aidilfitri open house on Borneo Convention Centre Kuching yesterday. On another matter, Abang Johari said he will go ahead with his plan to announce findings of a breakthrough study related to green and renewable energy next month. ""Next month I will announce a study that we have successfully explored related to green energy, which I feel in the long run will give better results to Sarawak. ""This is an incentive for our scientists to explore new fields and for this reason, I have added our scientists at the Sarawak Biodiversity Centre,"" he said. According to him, the announcement will be made before the coming State Legislative Assembly (DUN) sitting scheduled to start on May 15. ""This is a breakthrough from the point of view of green energy and also renewable energy that is very much desired by the world today ""Hopefully it will bring joy to the people of Sarawak,"" he said. To a question, he said the research had something to do with algae and plants found in Sarawak. On March 22, Abang Johari had said he will be announcing a world\'s first and Sarawak-produced technology in two months\' time. For the freshest news, join our Telegram Channel.

The manufacturer and the FAA said it doesn't affect flight safety but it will delay deliveries of the best-selling plane. Southwest Airlines and American Airlines are among the airlines expecting new Max aircraft. Boeing's warning that a production quality problem will delay deliveries of its best-selling 737 Max is another headache for airlines clamoring for new planes to handle a rebound in air travel, just ahead of the peak season. The problem is related to two of several brackets in the aft fuselage of some 737 Max planes, including the most popular model, the Max 8. Boeing has a backlog of 4,196 Max planes, according to a tally on its website. Boeing disclosed the production issue on Thursday but has not said how many planes are affected or how long deliveries could be delayed. The current delivery schedule of the planes stretches to the second half of the decade. The fuselage supplier, Spirit Aerosystems, Boeing and the FAA said the problem doesn't affect flight safety. But addressing the issue could mean time-consuming additional work. The two brackets in question are on the interior of the plane and are not as simple to reach as a concern on the outside of the fuselage would be, according to a person familiar with the matter. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun will likely comment on the issue during the company's annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday. Boeing disclosed the issue just weeks after an executive said it was gearing up to increase output of the jets from the current rate of 31 a month. Lengthy delays would be bad news for airlines already hamstrung by a global shortage of new aircraft. They could also hurt Boeing's plan to improve cash flow, since airlines pay the bulk of a plane's price upon delivery. Money Report It doesn't sound like it is going to be a terribly invasive fix, but on the other hand I think everyone's a bit spooked because of recent experience, said Richard Aboulafia, managing director of AeroDynamics Advisory. Southwest Airlines, which operates an all-Boeing 737 fleet, said it discussing the affects of the problem with the manufacturer. Boeing contacted us regarding an issue with a supplier's manufacturing process that will affect the delivery of Boeing 737 MAX planes to Southwest, the company said in a statement Thursday. We expect this to impact our current delivery schedule; we are in discussions with Boeing to understand what that impact will be in 2023 and beyond. CEO Bob Jordan said on an earnings call in January that the airline expects roughly 90 Max planes this year, lowering its forecast from 100 in light of recent discussions with Boeing and continued challenges in supply chain. American Airlines said it is also discussing the problem with Boeing. The airline has 88 Max aircraft on order, according to its 2022 report.

United Airlines, which reports on Tuesday said Boeing is keeping us informed about this issue, and at this time we do not expect any significant impact on our capacity plans for this summer or the rest of the year. The problem is the latest in a string of quality problems and aircraft delays at Boeing that has also included its 787 Dreamliner planes.

""We are watching the macroeconomic risks carefully, but demand remains strong, especially internationally, where we are growing at twice the domestic rate, CEO Scott Kirby said in a statement.

To take advantage of that international demand, United announced separately that it plans to expand service to Australia and New Zealand next winter by 40%. It will start new service or add flights on current routes from San Francisco and Los Angeles to Christchurch and Auckland in New Zealand and Sydney and Brisbane, Australia. Patrick Quayle, a senior vice president who oversees United\'s global network, said the airline will shift planes from Europe during winter, when travel between the U.S. and Australia and New Zealand is heaviest.

Best known for her roles in the series Chrisley Knows Best and Growing Up Chrisley, the 25-year-old took to her Instagram stories Thursday to share her awful experience with the airline. I went to board my flight and the employee told me that I had to check my bag, Chrisley said in the video, shared on Friday by Entertainment Weekly. I was like, 'Okay, if you wouldn't mind, I'm gonna take my bag on the flight, see if I can't make it fit and if not, I'll check it.' According to Chrisley, the Southwest employee said, No, that's not happening, and they went back and forth before the employee deemed her an unruly passenger, barring her from boarding In a statement to Insider, a representative from Southwest Airlines said Chrisley arrived late in the boarding process, when the overhead bins were already full. The employee asked her to check her bag at the gate to avoid delaying the more than 100 passengers already onboard the aircraft. She repeatedly insulted several Employees and as a result, the Customer was denied boarding on her original flight, and traveled on a later flight the same day, the spokesperson added.

Now, I'm not gonna lie, when this Southwest attendant told the pilot to calm down I told him that there was no need for him to be an asshole today and then he threw me off the flight. Afterward, Chrisley said she pleaded with the employee and shared that she had a 10-year-old she needed to get home to. According to People, she was referring to her niece, Chloe. Chrisley is now Chloe's primary guardian after her parents, Todd and Julie Chrisley, were sentenced to serve a combined 19 years in prison for bank fraud and tax evasion Todd and Julie Chrisley adopted Chloe in 2016, per People.

Free and customizable.© 2023 Particle Media Terms of Use Do Not Sell/Share My Info Help CenterComments / 0Community Policy "", 'A short film shot in Federal Way by a 2018 Kentridge High School graduate and up-and-coming filmmaker will start playing on Alaska Airlines flights this month. Titled ""The Fix,"" it\'s the story of a single working mother who asks for the help of her distant father for a last-minute babysitting request. The short film is an exploration of family dynamics and especially the relationships between parents and children in multigenerational families, director Emilio Torres said. The story is set in Torres\' parent\'s neighborhood of Belmor Park, the 55-and-over manufactured home community south of the Commons Mall. Belmor Park ""is an older community … and knowing Federal Way is a diverse community, I did feel there was something about this story (being in Federal Way) that made a lot of sense, because it is a (story) about multi-generational relationships,"" Torres said. The city itself isn\'t hugely relevant to the film, but it is significant. You can hear the highway next to the mall, or see the way the rain reflects on concrete, Torres said. ""The story is based my personal family, and my personal relationship with my own grandfather, and I think it sort of recontextualizes that with Latino family dynamics in general,"" Torres said. ""So I feel like it probably could be placed anywhere. But I like to make movies where I have reference, and where it makes sense for me."" His other Federal Way project — a music video for the \'80s throwback song ""Santa Carla"" by Belmez Faces — is just a bit different tonally It features a dancing vampire who haunts the parking lot of the Commons mall. Torres grew up in Ketchikan, Alaska, where his love of filmmaking first grew as he watched movies with his families and got involved in theatre. He got his first camera around 10 and decided he\'d be a director. He moved to Kent in 2014 and attended Kentridge, where he took theatre and video production classes that helped develop his skills. After graduating in 2018, he went to his dream school New York University, and his parents downsized and moved from Kent to Belmor Park. After graduating in 2021, he visited his hometown in Alaska to film a science fiction short called ""The Ladder."" He most recently came back to his parents\' neighborhood in Belmor Park, where he and his crew filmed ""The Fix."" Torres shot the film mostly indoors and over the course of a weekend. Despite being ""very low key"" compared to ""The Ladder,"" it went on to screen at 26 film festivals and pick up several awards, Torres said. Both films will be streaming on Alaska flights. It shows that in the creative world, you can never expect what project will bring the most success, Torres said. His previous projects in Federal Way and King County, for instance, helped him meet artists and actors and build the confidence to put together this one. His thesis film, shot in Washington, won prize money from an NYU contest that financed ""The Fix."" The people he worked with in Federal Way were excited about supporting the arts, Torres said ""I feel inspired there, and I felt supported by my neighbors and my fellow community members there."" In that way, his projects are all connected, and the success of one is linked to the success of the others, he said. ""In a creative field, you\'re just planting seeds out into the world, and you don\'t know which ones are actually going to grow into a tree"" he said. ""But somehow, it\'s all connected. … All these projects would not have been possible without relationships or people."" It\'s along those lines that he offers advice for any young filmmakers looking to perfect their craft. The Seattle area has a thriving filmmaker community, and organizations like the National Film Festival for Talented Youth, the Northwest Film Forum and the Seattle International Film Festival are great places to break into it, he said. Established filmmaking groups online can help novices improve, too. ""The Fix"" and other films he shot in Washington wouldn\'t have been possible without collaboration from other local artists, Torres said — so get to know your local art scene and find people who inspire and challenge you to improve. ""What\'s great is that you don\'t have to go to film school to be a filmmaker,"" Torres said. ""You can learn everything you need to do to make a short film on YouTube. However …. if you really want to grow and break into industry and level up your quality, there\'s only so much you can do on your own. Making relationships and meeting other people who can help you make your products come to fruition, that\'s what really steps up your game.""

Emirates amp; United Airlines Officially Launches Partnership As of today, Emirates and United Airlines' partnership with reciprocal benefits are fully live and United launched non-stop daily flights from Newark(EWR) to Dubai(DXB), which for the first time in seven years, it will connect the carrier to the UAE once again. Currently, Emirates is the only airline to connect the New York area to Dubai but now passengers will have the option to fly out from Newark on United as well. With United Airlines entering Dubai, passengers can then connect to their final destination with Emirates without any hassle. While it is good news for passengers to get a single ticket and connect baggage to their destinations, the frequent flyer program partnership is fairly restricted. Earning Miles on Emirates and United Starting today, members from both frequent flyer programs can earn miles when traveling on United or Emirate. However, there is a catch. In order to earn reciprocal miles on Emirates flights, United's MileagePlus members must book a flight that connects the Newark to Dubai or Dubai to Newark route. MileagePlus Earning Rates When Booked From United MileagePlus Earning Rates When Booked From Emirates In order to earn reciprocal miles on United flights, Emirates Skywards members must book United flights that are marketed by Emirates. In other words, bookings made from United's websites are not eligible when traveling solely on United. Earning Rates For Skywards Members Travelling On Flights Marketed By Emirates And Operated By United Airlines You can earn Skywards miles on United Airlines or United Express operated flights when one of the segments has the Newark to Dubai route with a connection with Emirates. Earning Rates For Skywards Members Travelling On Flights Marketed And Operated By United Airlines Redeeming Miles on Emirates and United The partnership between the two airlines also includes reciprocal award redemptions. Both frequent flyer programs can redeem on each flight but this too has a restriction, especially for United members. United's MileagePlus members can only redeem Emirates flights if their journey has a segment from Newark to Dubai or the other included and is limited to flights to Africa, the Middle East, and the South Asian Subcontinent. On the other hand, Emirates can book awards on United flights without restrictions. Below is the award chart for Skywards members redeeming on United flights. Emirates Award Redemption Chart On United To celebrate the commencement of the partnership, for a limited time, members can earn double miles when flying on eligible Emirates flights between March 26, 2023, and April 30, 2023.

Since Alaska, American Airlines and JetBlue are growing their partnership with Qatar Airways, Emirates joining United will be strategically beneficial. Summary As of March 26, 2023, the Emirates and United Airlines' partnership has officially launched and members from both programs are now able to enjoy reciprocal benefits to earn and redeem miles. However, the restrictions on mileage earning and redemptions were fairly disappointing as there are limitations on how you can earn reciprocal miles.

It was so surreal. It was hilarious. HOUSTON — A Southwest Airlines flight from Atlanta to Houston was delayed for one hour on Saturday because passengers said somebody wouldn't clean up the mess they made on the plane. Passengers said flight attendants refused to allow the pilot to take off until someone cleaned up rice that was spilled in the aisle. It was the end of a long day and apparently they had had a complete crew change, passenger Jennifer Schaper said. I'm sure they were tired. There had been a delay and we were tired. Schaper said she and her fellow passengers couldn't wait to get off the ground Saturday night. She was heading back to Houston from her trip to Atlanta. It wasn't until all the passengers had taken their seats that she saw the rice in the middle of the aisle. I didn't see it happen, but apparently one of the last passengers to board spilled a large amount of what looked like some sort of Asian fried rice ... and the flight attendant was really, really, mad about it, Schaper said. Mad enough to keep everyone grounded. She went up and down the aisle and asked each passenger one by one, loudly, who spilled the rice, Schaper said. My seatmates and I sort of got the giggles because it was so surreal. It was just hilarious. So she looked at us really suspiciously and asked us again if we spilled the rice and we said, 'No ma'am, we did not.' The situation continued to get tenser, and definitely more awkward, gauging from the expressions on the passengers' faces. Another flight attendant came and put a paper towel on it and said again we are not leaving this gate until someone cleans up this rice, Schaper said. But still, nobody would confess. (The flight attendant) gets on the loudspeaker and she says again that we are not leaving until this rice is cleaned. So she cleans the rice, the entire time she's telling all the passengers how nobody was raised right, and how disappointed she is in all of us, Schaper said. About an hour after the rice was first discovered, and after a sharp scolding from the crew, the plane finally took off. Schaper said whoever made the mess should have just taken responsibility. I'm sure after that they didn't want to admit to it, but yeah, they should've cleaned it up, she said. Nevertheless, what's the use of crying over spilled rice? The whole thing was really comical and I kind of saw the light side of the situation, Schaper said. We're all stuck there, we may as well make it funny. A spokesperson from Southwest Airlines said they weren't familiar with the incident, but that their flight attendants do a tremendous job ensuring the comfort and safety of their customers. Matt Dougherty on social media Facebook Twitter Instagram "", 'A Southwest Airlines flight was delayed by more than an hour after attendants refused to allow the plane to leave until a pile of rice in the aisle was cleared up Passengers said the mess was made almost immediately after travelers began boarding the plane from Atlanta, Georgia, to Houston, Texas, on Saturday Jennifer Schaper, who recorded the incident on Twitter, wrote \'The flight attendant screamed ""who spilled rice?"" and is walking up and down the aisles.

She has let us all know that we were not raised right and she is disappointed in all of us.\'To make matters worse, Schaper added that the flight was even more delayed because \'an oblivious passenger took advantage of RiceGateto use the bathroom and further delay the flight.\'She later joked that she and her row-mates had nicknamed the flight \'The Voyage of The Damned\' When the flight finally landed in Houston, Schaper took to social media to provide an \'update\', quipping \'There were a few bumps so they didn\'t give us beverage service.

A man had to be escorted off a Southwest flight by cops when it landed in Orlando, Florida, on Wednesday after throwing an epic tantrum over a screaming child. The passenger was recorded midair screaming and claiming the baby had been crying nonstop for 45 minutes. The ordeal unfolded when the flight was forced into a holding pattern around the area outside Palm Beach due to a bad weather front On Tuesday, Southwest were forced to briefly ground all flights nationwide after a technical issue – leading to 2,400 delayed flights. The hold on departures backed up traffic at airports from Denver to New York City, and came just months after the airline suffered an epic system meltdown over the holiday travel rush in December. Exclusive data for DailyMail.com this week revealed Southwest was among the worst offenders for flight delays in the last year. From April 2022 to April 2023, Southwest suffered delays on a quarter of its flights – second only to JetBlue Airways which was late for 31.6% of its journeys, according to flight tracking platform FlightAware. A Southwest airlines spokesperson told DailyMail.com \'This appears to be a normal departure, and we do not have any flight irregularity reports or specifics surrounding the passenger claims.

Officials want to make sure 2023 is not a repeat of last year, when the peak summer travel season was marred by ""airport chaos"" headlines and flight delays often ran into the tens of thousands per day. On Monday, Canadian Transport Minister Omar Alghabra laid out measures to stiffen penalties for delayed and canceled flights into, from or within Canada. If the changes are adopted, compensation will be the default. The onus will be on airlines to prove that a flight disruption was caused by a reason outside their control, such as a snowstorm. Airlines would also need to establish an internal process for dealing with air travel claims efficiently. ""This means there will be no more loopholes where airlines can claim a disruption is caused by something outside of their control or a security reason when it is not,"" Alghabra told reporters. ""It will no longer be the passenger who will have to prove that he or she is entitled to compensation. It will now be the airline that will need to prove that it does not have to pay for it."" Air travel complaints have reached record levels in Canada, just as they have in the United States. The Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA), the tribunal that enforces passenger refund requirements, reportedly has a backlog of more than 44,000 complaints. In 2022, the U.S. Department of Transportation received 77,656 complaints about airlines, the majority of which concerned refunds or a lack of reimbursements for expenses incurred due to flight disruptions. Since last summer\'s meltdown, the U.S. has rolled out some consumer-oriented guardrails of its own. Just before Labor Day last year, the Department of Transportation rolled out an Aviation Consumer Protection website that shows side-by-side comparisons of what each airline offers in the event of a controllable delay or cancellation. For example, vouchers are provided if disruptions are caused by an issue like understaffing or a technical glitch but not if flights are delayed or cancelled for reasons outside an airline\'s control, such as weather. Last November, Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg announced that his department has fined airlines more than 8 million for slow walking refunds to consumers after their flights were canceled or significantly disrupted. Those fines are widely viewed as a slap on the wrist for carriers that earning hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue per quarter. Jeff Morrison, CEO of the National Airlines Council of Canada (NACC), which represents the country\'s largest carriers, including Air Canada, said in a statement that Alghabra\'s proposed measures were a ""punitive approach"" that ""will not improve the operation of Canada\'s air travel system or the travel experience for customers."" The airline lobby group also played the inflation card, warning that the government\'s proposed change would ultimately bite passengers in the wallet. ""By imposing a new fee for passenger claims submitted to the Canadian Transportation Agency and expanding compensation requirements, the cost of air travel may increase,"" Morrison said. Check out my website. Send me a secure tip. ', ""The route to a better travel experience runs through airport upgrades and greater accountability across the range of aviation players, he said. Airlines are being forced to continue shouldering sole responsibility for all organizations in the overall system, over which they have no control, Morrison said. Tabled in the House of Commons as part of a budget implementation bill Thursday, the amendments ratchet up the maximum penalty for airline violations to 250,000 -- a tenfold increase -- and put the regulatory cost of complaints on carriers. In theory, that measure gives airlines an incentive to brush up their service and thus reduce the number of grievances against them. Alghabra defended placing the financial weight squarely on carriers. The customer paid the airlines to receive a service. Therefore the airlines are responsible for delivering that service, the minister said, adding that the federal budget mandates data sharing and thus broader accountability in the aviation sector. The legislation also demands that airlines institute a process to deal with claims and respond to complaints with a decision within 30 days. The establishment of complaint resolution officers at the Canadian Transportation Agency should also expedite the process for complaints, as should a 60-day maximum for the regulator to handle them, some advocates say. It is not clear what the penalty for breaching those timelines might be. The complaints backlog at the agency now stands at about 45,000, more than triple the tally from a year ago and requiring at least 18 months on average per case. Some advocates cast doubt on whether the so-called safety loophole for compensation was really shut tight. The way it was sold today was, 'We got rid of the three categories, ' -- within the airline's control, outside its control and safety concerns, with the latter two reasons for a delayed or cancelled flight exempting an airline from compensating passengers -- said John Lawford, executive director of the Public Interest Advocacy Centre. Instead of the flight disruption categories, the Canadian Transportation Agency would draft a list of exceptions for compensation, including bad weather, the minister said. I'm sure the airlines will say, 'Well, one of them should be safety, Lawford predicted. Gabor Lukacs, president of the Air Passenger Rights advocacy group, questioned confidentiality rules for the complaints process and called for more transparency. While decisions by complaint officers would mandate the publication of some information, such as a flight number and date and whether compensation was issued -- to alert fellow passengers to their own potential payout -- what is not becoming public is the evidence and the reasons and the analysis, he said. What happens with mediation is still a black box, Lukacs added. My impression remains that this is essentially a smokescreen, and that it is going to be a secretive process that will cover up the real problems that passengers are facing. NDP transport critic Taylor Bachrach, who has tabled a private member's bill on passenger rights, expressed skepticism as to whether the Canadian Transportation Agency could be entrusted to write regulations reasonable to all sides. They're far too close to the airlines themselves. And so we have a regulator that is in some ways captured by the industry. And we've seen that in its decisions over the past number of years, he told reporters. The agency dismissed the accusation. The CTA preserves the level of independence the Canada Transportation Act requires and ensures that parties' right to an impartial decision-maker is respected, said spokeswoman Martine Malais in an email. Bachrach also said the proposed law fails to fully close the so-called safety loophole and falls short of European passenger rights standards. When we look at the European model, it's been working for over a decade. And I can't explain why the minister hasn't chosen to emulate that model. He's trying to reinvent the wheel and it's not necessary. "", 'said council president Jeff Morrison in a statement.
